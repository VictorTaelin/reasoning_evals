#Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.

To analyze and explain each function, let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Function A**: 
   ```javascript
   A = x => u => v => u(x);
   ```
   - This function takes an argument `x` and returns a function that takes `u` and `v` as arguments. It then applies `u` to `x`. Essentially, it ignores `v` and returns the result of `u(x)`.

2. **Function B**: 
   ```javascript
   B = u => v => v;
   ```
   - This function takes two arguments `u` and `v`, and simply returns `v`. It ignores `u`.

3. **Function C**: 
   ```javascript
   C = x => x > 0 ? A(C(x-1)) : B;
   ```
   - This is a recursive function that constructs a nested application of `A` functions if `x` is greater than 0. If `x` is 0 or less, it returns `B`. For a positive integer `x`, `C(x)` will create a chain of `A` functions applied `x` times, ending with `B`.

4. **Function D**: 
   ```javascript
   D = x => x(y => 1+D(y))(0);
   ```
   - This function takes a function `x` and applies it to a function `y => 1 + D(y)`, then applies the result to `0`. This effectively counts the number of times `x` can apply the function `y => 1 + D(y)` before reaching a base case.

5. **Function E**: 
   ```javascript
   E = a => a(b => b(c => x => x(y => E(c)(y))(x))(x => x))(x => x);
   ```
   - This function takes a function `a` and applies it to a complex function that involves nested applications. The inner workings involve applying `b` to a function that applies `c` to a function that applies `x` to another function. This is a form of fixed-point combinator, which is used to achieve recursion.

6. **Function F**: 
   ```javascript
   F = a => b => D(E(C(a))(C(b)));
   ```
   - This function takes two arguments `a` and `b`, applies `C` to both, and then applies `E` to the result of `C(a)`, followed by `C(b)`. The result is then passed to `D`.

### Simplified Explanation:

- **C(x)**: Constructs a chain of `A` functions applied `x` times, ending with `B`.
- **E**: Acts as a fixed-point combinator, allowing recursive behavior.
- **D**: Counts the number of applications of a function until a base case is reached.

### Simplified Formula for F:

The function `F(a)(b)` essentially computes the minimum of `a` and `b`. Here's why:

- `C(a)` and `C(b)` create chains of `A` functions of length `a` and `b`, respectively.
- `E(C(a))(C(b))` effectively combines these chains in a way that simulates the behavior of a minimum function.
- `D` then counts how many times the function can be applied, which corresponds to the minimum of the two numbers.

Thus, the simplified formula for `F` is:

\[ F(a, b) = \min(a, b) \]

This is because the construction and evaluation of the functions ultimately result in counting the minimum number of applications possible between the two inputs.



RESULTS:

- Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.
- A0: By noticing A/B are Î»-Nat constructors, we can reconstruct E's pattern-matching structure, which lets us simplify it to E(a,b) = if a > 1 and b > 0 { E(a-2, b-1) } else { b }, which lets us conclude that F(a,b) = b - floor(a/2).
- J0: AI analyzed functions individually and concluded F(a,b) = min(a,b), missing the correct pattern-matching structure.
- SC: 0
