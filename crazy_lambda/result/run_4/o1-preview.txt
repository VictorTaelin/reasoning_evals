#Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.

To analyze and explain each function and simplify `F`, we'll interpret the given JavaScript functions in terms of lambda calculus and Church numerals.

**1. Function A:**

```javascript
A = x => u => v => u(x);
```

- **Explanation:** `A` is a higher-order function that takes an argument `x` and returns a function that takes two functions `u` and `v`. When called with `u` and `v`, it applies `u` to `x`, effectively ignoring `v`. This function constructs the successor function used in Church numerals.

- **Equivalent in Lambda Calculus:** `A(x) = λu.λv.u(x)`

**2. Function B:**

```javascript
B = u => v => v;
```

- **Explanation:** `B` is a constant function that takes two functions `u` and `v` and returns `v`, ignoring `u`. This represents the numeral zero in Church encoding.

- **Equivalent in Lambda Calculus:** `B = λu.λv.v`

**3. Function C:**

```javascript
C = x => x > 0 ? A(C(x-1)) : B;
```

- **Explanation:** `C` is a recursive function that builds up Church numerals for natural numbers. For a positive integer `x`, it constructs the Church numeral by applying the successor function `A` recursively `x` times starting from `B`.

- **Behavior:**
  - `C(0) = B` (Church numeral zero)
  - `C(n) = A(C(n-1))` (Constructs the Church numeral `n`)

- **Equivalent in Lambda Calculus:** `C(n) ≈ (Church numeral for n)`

**4. Function D:**

```javascript
D = x => x(y => 1 + D(y))(0);
```

- **Explanation:** `D` converts a Church numeral back into a JavaScript number. It applies the numeral `x` to a function that increments the result and starts from `0`. This effectively counts the number of times the function is applied, which corresponds to the integer value of the numeral.

- **Behavior:**
  - `D(C(n)) = n` (Converts the Church numeral `n` to the integer `n`)

- **Equivalent in Lambda Calculus:** `D = λx.x(λy.1 + D(y))(0)`

**5. Function E:**

```javascript
E = a => a(b => b(c => x => x(y => E(c)(y))(x))(x => x))(x => x);
```

- **Explanation:** `E` computes the predecessor of a Church numeral. It recursively traverses the numeral `a` and effectively subtracts one from it. This is known as the predecessor function in Church numerals.

- **Behavior:**
  - `E(C(n)) ≈ C(n-1)` for `n > 0`
  - `E(C(0)) = C(0)` (Predecessor of zero is zero)

- **Equivalent in Lambda Calculus:** `E = λa.a(λb.b(λc.λx.x(λy.E(c)(y))(x))(λx.x))(λx.x)`

**6. Function F:**

```javascript
F = a => b => D(E(C(a))(C(b)));
```

- **Explanation:** `F` computes the subtraction of two numbers `a` and `b` using Church numerals. It converts `a` and `b` into Church numerals using `C`, finds the predecessor of `a` applied `b` times using `E`, and then converts the result back to a JavaScript number using `D`.

- **Simplified Formula:**

  ```javascript
  F(a, b) = a - b;
  ```

**Conclusion:**

- **Simplifying F:** Since `E` computes the predecessor and `D` converts a Church numeral to a number, `F(a, b)` effectively computes `a - b` for numbers `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the simplified formula equivalent to `F` is:

**Simplified Formula:**
```javascript
F(a, b) = a - b;
```

---

**Answer:** A detailed analysis shows that `F(a, b)` calculates `a − b`; thus, the simplified formula is **F(a, b) = a − b**.



RESULTS:

- Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.
- A0: By noticing A/B are λ-Nat constructors, we can reconstruct E's pattern-matching structure, which lets us simplify it to E(a,b) = if a > 1 and b > 0 { E(a-2, b-1) } else { b }, which lets us conclude that F(a,b) = b - floor(a/2).
- J0: AI analyzed functions as Church numerals and concluded F(a,b) = a - b.
