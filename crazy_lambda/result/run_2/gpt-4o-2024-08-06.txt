#Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.

To analyze and explain each function, let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Function A**: 
   ```javascript
   A = x => u => v => u(x);
   ```
   - This is a higher-order function that takes three arguments: `x`, `u`, and `v`.
   - It returns the result of applying `u` to `x`, effectively ignoring `v`.
   - In lambda calculus terms, this is similar to the application of a function to an argument.

2. **Function B**:
   ```javascript
   B = u => v => v;
   ```
   - This is a constant function that takes two arguments `u` and `v` and returns `v`, ignoring `u`.
   - In lambda calculus, this is akin to the K combinator, which always returns the second argument.

3. **Function C**:
   ```javascript
   C = x => x > 0 ? A(C(x-1)) : B;
   ```
   - This is a recursive function that constructs a nested application of `A` functions if `x` is greater than 0, otherwise it returns `B`.
   - For a positive integer `x`, `C(x)` will create a chain of `A` applications of length `x`, ending with `B`.

4. **Function D**:
   ```javascript
   D = x => x(y => 1+D(y))(0);
   ```
   - This function takes a function `x` and applies it to a function `y => 1 + D(y)`, then applies the result to `0`.
   - This effectively counts the number of times `x` can apply the function `y => 1 + D(y)` before reaching a base case.
   - In essence, `D` computes the number of nested applications in `x`.

5. **Function E**:
   ```javascript
   E = a => a(b => b(c => x => x(y => E(c)(y))(x))(x => x))(x => x);
   ```
   - This function takes a function `a` and applies it to a complex function that involves recursive applications of `E`.
   - The inner workings involve applying `b` to a function that applies `x` to another function, which recursively calls `E`.
   - This is a form of fixed-point combinator, which is used to achieve recursion.

6. **Function F**:
   ```javascript
   F = a => b => D(E(C(a))(C(b)));
   ```
   - This function takes two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - It constructs two chains of applications using `C(a)` and `C(b)`.
   - It then applies `E` to these chains, and finally applies `D` to the result.
   - The purpose of `F` is to compute the result of multiplying `a` and `b`.

### Simplified Formula for F

Given the analysis above, the function `F` effectively computes the product of two numbers `a` and `b`. The function `C` creates a chain of applications representing the number, `E` combines these chains, and `D` counts the total number of applications, which corresponds to multiplication.

Therefore, the simplified formula equivalent to `F` is:

\[ F(a, b) = a \times b \]

This is because the function `F` is essentially implementing multiplication through recursive application and counting.



RESULTS:

- Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.
- A0: By noticing A/B are λ-Nat constructors, we can reconstruct E's pattern-matching structure, which lets us simplify it to E(a,b) = if a > 1 and b > 0 { E(a-2, b-1) } else { b }, which lets us conclude that F(a,b) = b - floor(a/2).
- J0: AI analyzed each function but incorrectly concluded F(a,b) = a × b, missing the actual pattern-matching structure.
- SC: 0
