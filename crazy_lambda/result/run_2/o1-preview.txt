#Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.

To simplify and explain the function `F`, we'll analyze each of the functions `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and `E` step by step.

**1. Understanding Functions A, B, and C:**

- **Function A:**
  ```javascript
  A = x => u => v => u(x);
  ```
  - `A` takes an argument `x` and returns a function that takes `u` and `v` and returns `u(x)`.
  - This function is similar to the **`K` combinator** (constant function) in lambda calculus, but with an extra layer.

- **Function B:**
  ```javascript
  B = u => v => v;
  ```
  - `B` takes `u` and `v` and returns `v`.
  - This is the **`K'` combinator** or the "flip" of `K`.

- **Function C:**
  ```javascript
  C = x => x > 0 ? A(C(x-1)) : B;
  ```
  - `C` is a recursive function that builds up nested applications of `A`.
  - When `x` is 0, `C(0) = B`.
  - For `x > 0`, it constructs `A` applied to `C(x-1)`.
  - Effectively, `C(x)` constructs a **Church numeral** representing the number `x`.

**2. Understanding Function D:**

```javascript
D = x => x(y => 1 + D(y))(0);
```

- `D` takes a Church numeral `x` and converts it to a JavaScript number.
- It does this by applying `x` to a function that adds 1, starting from 0.
- For example, `D(C(3))` would compute to `3`.

**3. Understanding Function E:**

```javascript
E = a => a(b => b(c => x => x(y => E(c)(y))(x))(x => x))(x => x);
```

- `E` is a higher-order function that performs **addition** on Church numerals.
- It takes a Church numeral `a` and returns a function that can add another Church numeral to `a`.
- The recursion and function applications within `E` effectively implement the addition operation in lambda calculus.

**4. Simplifying Function F:**

```javascript
F = a => b => D(E(C(a))(C(b)));
```

- `F` takes two numbers `a` and `b`.
- `C(a)` and `C(b)` convert `a` and `b` into Church numerals.
- `E(C(a))(C(b))` adds the two Church numerals, resulting in a Church numeral representing `a + b`.
- `D` then converts this Church numeral back into a JavaScript number.
- Therefore, `F(a, b)` computes the sum of `a` and `b`.

**Final Simplified Formula:**

```javascript
F(a, b) = a + b;
```

So, the simplified formula equivalent to `F` is:

**Answer: An explicit formula: F(a, b) equals a ＋ b; that is, F(a, b) = a + b.



RESULTS:

- Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.
- A0: By noticing A/B are λ-Nat constructors, we can reconstruct E's pattern-matching structure, which lets us simplify it to E(a,b) = if a > 1 and b > 0 { E(a-2, b-1) } else { b }, which lets us conclude that F(a,b) = b - floor(a/2).
- J0: AI incorrectly interpreted functions as Church numerals and addition, leading to an incorrect simplification.
- SC: 0
