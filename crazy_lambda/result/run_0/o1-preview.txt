#Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.

To analyze the functions and find a simplified formula for \( F(a)(b) \), let's step through each function and interpret their behaviors, drawing parallels with concepts from lambda calculus and Church encoding of natural numbers.

**Function A:**

```javascript
A = x => u => v => u(x);
```
This function takes an argument \( x \) and returns a function that takes two more arguments \( u \) and \( v \). When all three arguments are provided, it evaluates to \( u(x) \). This can be seen as applying \( u \) to \( x \).

**Function B:**

```javascript
B = u => v => v;
```
This function ignores its first argument \( u \) and always returns its second argument \( v \). This is akin to the boolean value **false** in lambda calculus, which selects the second of two options.

**Function C:**

```javascript
C = x => x > 0 ? A(C(x - 1)) : B;
```
This is a recursive function that builds up a chain of applications of \( A \) to \( B \). For \( x > 0 \), it applies \( A \) to \( C(x - 1) \); when \( x \) reaches 0, it returns \( B \). Effectively, \( C(n) \) constructs \( A \) applied \( n \) times to \( B \).

**Function D:**

```javascript
D = x => x(y => 1 + D(y))(0);
```
This function computes the "depth" of the structure created by \( x \). When \( x \) is \( B \), it returns 0. When \( x \) is built up from applications of \( A \), it counts how many times \( A \) has been applied. Thus, \( D(C(n)) = n \).

**Function E:**

```javascript
E = a => a(b => b(c => x => x(y => E(c)(y))(x))(x => x))(x => x);
```
Function \( E \) is more complex. It operates on the structure created by \( C(a) \). Its role is to create a function that, when applied to another structure \( C(b) \), transforms it in a way that simulates exponentiation.

Let's interpret \( E(C(a)) \) as a function that, when applied to \( C(b) \), builds up a new structure equivalent to \( C(b^a) \).

**Function F:**

```javascript
F = a => b => D(E(C(a))(C(b)));
```
Function \( F \) composes the previous functions to compute \( D(E(C(a))(C(b))) \). Since \( E(C(a))(C(b)) \) corresponds to \( C(b^a) \), and \( D(C(n)) = n \), we have:

\[ F(a)(b) = D(E(C(a))(C(b))) = D(C(b^a)) = b^a \]

**Simplified Formula:**

Therefore, the function \( F(a)(b) \) computes \( b^a \). The exponentiation operation corresponds to the repeated application of functions in the lambda calculus representation.

**Answer:**

An explicit formula: F(a)(b) = b to the power a; that is, F(a)(b) = bᵃ



RESULTS:

- Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.
- A0: By noticing A/B are λ-Nat constructors, we can reconstruct E's pattern-matching structure, which lets us simplify it to E(a,b) = if a > 1 and b > 0 { E(a-2, b-1) } else { b }, which lets us conclude that F(a,b) = b - floor(a/2).
- J0: AI interpreted functions as Church encodings and concluded F(a)(b) = b^a, missing the actual pattern in E.
- SC: 0
