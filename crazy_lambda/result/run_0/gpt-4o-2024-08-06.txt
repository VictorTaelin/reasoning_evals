#Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.

To analyze and simplify the given JavaScript functions, let's break down each function step by step:

1. **Function A**: 
   ```javascript
   A = x => u => v => u(x);
   ```
   - This is a higher-order function that takes three arguments: `x`, `u`, and `v`.
   - It returns the result of applying `u` to `x`, effectively ignoring `v`.

2. **Function B**: 
   ```javascript
   B = u => v => v;
   ```
   - This is a constant function that takes two arguments `u` and `v`.
   - It returns `v`, effectively ignoring `u`.

3. **Function C**: 
   ```javascript
   C = x => x > 0 ? A(C(x-1)) : B;
   ```
   - This is a recursive function that constructs a nested application of `A` if `x` is greater than 0.
   - If `x` is 0 or less, it returns `B`.
   - Essentially, `C(x)` creates a chain of `A` applications of length `x`, ending with `B`.

4. **Function D**: 
   ```javascript
   D = x => x(y => 1+D(y))(0);
   ```
   - This function takes a function `x` and applies it to a function `y => 1 + D(y)`, starting with `0`.
   - It effectively counts the number of times `x` can apply the function `y => 1 + D(y)` before reaching a base case.

5. **Function E**: 
   ```javascript
   E = a => a(b => b(c => x => x(y => E(c)(y))(x))(x => x))(x => x);
   ```
   - This function takes a function `a` and applies it to a complex nested function.
   - The inner workings involve recursive applications, but the key is that it processes the structure created by `C`.

6. **Function F**: 
   ```javascript
   F = a => b => D(E(C(a))(C(b)));
   ```
   - This function combines the results of `C(a)` and `C(b)` using `E`, and then applies `D` to the result.
   - The goal is to count the interactions between the structures created by `C(a)` and `C(b)`.

### Simplification

The key to simplifying `F` is understanding that `C(x)` creates a chain of `A` applications of length `x`, ending with `B`. The function `E` processes this chain, and `D` counts the effective length of the chain.

- `C(a)` creates a chain of `A` applications of length `a`.
- `C(b)` creates a chain of `A` applications of length `b`.
- `E(C(a))(C(b))` effectively combines these chains, resulting in a structure that represents the minimum of `a` and `b`.
- `D` then counts the length of this combined structure.

Thus, the function `F(a)(b)` effectively computes the minimum of `a` and `b`.

### Simplified Formula

The simplified formula equivalent to `F` is:

\[ F(a, b) = \min(a, b) \]

This is because the nested applications and recursive structures ultimately result in counting the minimum number of applications possible between the two chains created by `C(a)` and `C(b)`.



RESULTS:

- Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.
- A0: By noticing A/B are λ-Nat constructors, we can reconstruct E's pattern-matching structure, which lets us simplify it to E(a,b) = if a > 1 and b > 0 { E(a-2, b-1) } else { b }, which lets us conclude that F(a,b) = b - floor(a/2).
- J0: AI analyzed each function but incorrectly concluded F(a,b) = min(a,b) without recognizing λ-Nat constructors or deriving the correct pattern-matching structure.
- SC: 0
