#Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.

To analyze and explain each function, let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Function A**: 
   ```javascript
   A = x => u => v => u(x);
   ```
   - This function takes three arguments: `x`, `u`, and `v`.
   - It returns the result of applying the function `u` to `x`.
   - Essentially, it ignores `v` and applies `u` to `x`.

2. **Function B**:
   ```javascript
   B = u => v => v;
   ```
   - This function takes two arguments: `u` and `v`.
   - It returns `v`, effectively ignoring `u`.

3. **Function C**:
   ```javascript
   C = x => x > 0 ? A(C(x-1)) : B;
   ```
   - This is a recursive function that takes a number `x`.
   - If `x` is greater than 0, it returns `A(C(x-1))`, which is a function that applies `C(x-1)` to its first argument.
   - If `x` is 0 or less, it returns `B`.
   - This function constructs a chain of applications based on the value of `x`.

4. **Function D**:
   ```javascript
   D = x => x(y => 1+D(y))(0);
   ```
   - This function takes a function `x` as an argument.
   - It applies `x` to a function `y => 1 + D(y)` and then applies the result to `0`.
   - This effectively counts the number of times `x` can be applied to its argument before reaching a base case.

5. **Function E**:
   ```javascript
   E = a => a(b => b(c => x => x(y => E(c)(y))(x))(x => x))(x => x);
   ```
   - This function takes a function `a` as an argument.
   - It applies `a` to a function that applies its argument `b` to another function.
   - This inner function applies `c` to a function that applies `x` to another function.
   - The structure of `E` suggests it is a form of fixed-point combinator, which is used to achieve recursion.

6. **Function F**:
   ```javascript
   F = a => b => D(E(C(a))(C(b)));
   ```
   - This function takes two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - It applies `C(a)` and `C(b)` to `E`, and then applies the result to `D`.
   - The function `F` essentially counts the number of applications of `C(a)` and `C(b)`.

### Simplified Formula for F

The function `F` is essentially computing the sum of two numbers `a` and `b`. Here's why:

- `C(a)` creates a chain of `a` applications of `A` followed by `B`.
- `C(b)` creates a chain of `b` applications of `A` followed by `B`.
- `E` is used to combine these chains into a single function that represents the sum of the two chains.
- `D` counts the number of applications in this combined chain, which is `a + b`.

Therefore, the simplified formula equivalent to `F` is:

\[ F(a, b) = a + b \]

This function `F` effectively computes the sum of the two input numbers `a` and `b`.



RESULTS:

- Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.
- A0: By noticing A/B are λ-Nat constructors, we can reconstruct E's pattern-matching structure, which lets us simplify it to E(a,b) = if a > 1 and b > 0 { E(a-2, b-1) } else { b }, which lets us conclude that F(a,b) = b - floor(a/2).
- J0: The AI analyzed each function but incorrectly concluded F(a,b) = a + b, missing the λ-Nat structure and E's pattern-matching.
- SC: 0
