#Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.

To analyze the given JavaScript functions and simplify \( F \), we'll consider each function step by step and interpret them in the context of lambda calculus and Church numerals.

**Function A:**

```javascript
A = x => u => v => u(x);
```

This function takes an argument \( x \) and returns a function that takes \( u \) and \( v \), ultimately returning \( u(x) \).

In lambda calculus notation:
\[ A = \lambda x. \lambda u. \lambda v. \ u(x) \]

**Function B:**

```javascript
B = u => v => v;
```

This function ignores \( u \) and returns \( v \). 

In lambda calculus:
\[ B = \lambda u. \lambda v. \ v \]

**Function C:**

```javascript
C = x => x > 0 ? A(C(x-1)) : B;
```

This function recursively builds a chain of \( A \)'s applied to \( B \) based on the integer \( x \).

- For \( x = 0 \):
  \[ C(0) = B \]
- For \( x > 0 \):
  \[ C(n) = A(C(n-1)) \]

By unfolding, \( C(n) \) becomes a Church numeral representing \( n \):
\[ C(n)(u)(v) = u^n(v) \]

**Function D:**

```javascript
D = x => x(y => 1 + D(y))(0);
```

This function evaluates a Church numeral into its integer value.

- It applies \( x \) (a Church numeral) to the function \( y \mapsto 1 + D(y) \), starting from \( 0 \).
- For a Church numeral \( C(n) \):
  \[ D(C(n)) = n \]

**Function E:**

```javascript
E = a => a(b => b(c => x => x(y => E(c)(y))(x))(x => x))(x => x);
```

This function seems complex, but when we analyze it, we find:

- \( E(C(n))(x) = x \) for any \( n \).
- Essentially, \( E \) processes its argument but ultimately acts like an identity function for the provided Church numeral.

**Function F:**

```javascript
F = a => b => D(E(C(a))(C(b)));
```

Given our understanding of \( D \), \( E \), and \( C \):

- \( E(C(a))(C(b)) = C(b) \)
- Therefore:
  \[ F(a)(b) = D(C(b)) = b \]

**Simplified Formula:**

The function \( F \) simply returns its second argument \( b \), regardless of \( a \):

\[ F(a)(b) = b \]

Thus, after deobfuscating, \( F \) is equivalent to the identity function on its second argument.

**Answer:**

An explicit formula:  **F(a)(b) = b** —that is, F always returns its second argument b



RESULTS:

- Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.
- A0: By noticing A/B are λ-Nat constructors, we can reconstruct E's pattern-matching structure, which lets us simplify it to E(a,b) = if a > 1 and b > 0 { E(a-2, b-1) } else { b }, which lets us conclude that F(a,b) = b - floor(a/2).
- J0: AI analyzed each function but misinterpreted E's behavior, leading to an incorrect simplification of F.
- SC: 0
