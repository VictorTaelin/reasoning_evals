#Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.

To analyze and explain each function, let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Function A**: 
   ```javascript
   A = x => u => v => u(x);
   ```
   - This is a higher-order function that takes three arguments: `x`, `u`, and `v`.
   - It returns the result of applying `u` to `x`, effectively ignoring `v`.

2. **Function B**:
   ```javascript
   B = u => v => v;
   ```
   - This is a constant function that takes two arguments: `u` and `v`.
   - It returns `v`, effectively ignoring `u`.

3. **Function C**:
   ```javascript
   C = x => x > 0 ? A(C(x-1)) : B;
   ```
   - This is a recursive function that takes a number `x`.
   - If `x` is greater than 0, it returns a function `A(C(x-1))`, which is a composition of `A` and the result of `C(x-1)`.
   - If `x` is 0 or less, it returns `B`.

4. **Function D**:
   ```javascript
   D = x => x(y => 1+D(y))(0);
   ```
   - This function takes a function `x` as an argument.
   - It applies `x` to a function `y => 1 + D(y)` and then applies the result to `0`.
   - This effectively computes the number of times `x` can be applied to the function `y => 1 + D(y)` starting from `0`, which is a way to count applications.

5. **Function E**:
   ```javascript
   E = a => a(b => b(c => x => x(y => E(c)(y))(x))(x => x))(x => x);
   ```
   - This is a complex higher-order function that takes a function `a`.
   - It applies `a` to a function that takes `b`, which is then applied to another function that takes `c`.
   - The innermost function applies `x` to a function that applies `E(c)` to `y`, and then applies this to `x`.
   - This is a form of fixed-point combinator, which is used to achieve recursion.

6. **Function F**:
   ```javascript
   F = a => b => D(E(C(a))(C(b)));
   ```
   - This function takes two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - It computes `C(a)` and `C(b)`, which are functions based on the recursive structure defined in `C`.
   - It applies `E` to the result of `C(a)` and then applies the result to `C(b)`.
   - Finally, it applies `D` to the result of `E(C(a))(C(b))`.

### Simplified Formula for F

The function `F` essentially computes the product of two numbers `a` and `b`. Here's why:

- `C(n)` constructs a Church numeral representation of the number `n`.
- `E` is a fixed-point combinator that allows for recursive application, effectively implementing multiplication of Church numerals.
- `D` converts a Church numeral back to a JavaScript number by counting the number of applications.

Therefore, the simplified formula for `F` is:

\[ F(a, b) = a \times b \]

This is because `F` takes two numbers `a` and `b`, converts them to Church numerals, multiplies them using the Church numeral multiplication process, and then converts the result back to a standard JavaScript number.



RESULTS:

- Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.
- A0: By noticing A/B are Î»-Nat constructors, we can reconstruct E's pattern-matching structure, which lets us simplify it to E(a,b) = if a > 1 and b > 0 { E(a-2, b-1) } else { b }, which lets us conclude that F(a,b) = b - floor(a/2).
- J0: AI analyzed functions individually and concluded F computes the product of a and b using Church numerals.
- SC: 0
