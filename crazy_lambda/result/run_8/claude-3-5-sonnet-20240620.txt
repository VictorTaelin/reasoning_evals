#Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.

Let's analyze each function and then simplify F:

A(x)(u)(v) = u(x)
A takes three arguments and returns the result of applying the second argument to the first.

B(u)(v) = v
B takes two arguments and returns the second one.

C(x) = if x > 0 then A(C(x-1)) else B
C is a recursive function. If x > 0, it calls itself with x-1 and wraps the result in A. If x ≤ 0, it returns B.

D(x) = x(y → 1 + D(y))(0)
D is also recursive. It applies x to a function that adds 1 to the recursive call of D, and to 0.

E(a) = a(b → b(c → x → x(y → E(c)(y))(x))(x → x))(x → x)
E is a complex recursive function that applies its argument in a nested manner.

F(a)(b) = D(E(C(a))(C(b)))
F applies C to both its arguments, then applies E to the results, and finally applies D to that result.

Analyzing the behavior:

1. C(x) effectively creates a chain of A functions of length x when x > 0, or B when x ≤ 0.
2. E seems to combine its two arguments in a way that results in nested function applications.
3. D counts the depth of the function produced by E(C(a))(C(b)).

After careful analysis, it appears that F(a)(b) is equivalent to:

F(a, b) = max(a, b)

This is because:
- C(a) and C(b) create chains of length a and b respectively.
- E combines these chains in a way that preserves the longer one.
- D then counts the depth of this combined structure, which is equal to the maximum of a and b.

Therefore, the simplified formula equivalent to F is:

F(a, b) = max(a, b)



RESULTS:

- Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.
- A0: By noticing A/B are λ-Nat constructors, we can reconstruct E's pattern-matching structure, which lets us simplify it to E(a,b) = if a > 1 and b > 0 { E(a-2, b-1) } else { b }, which lets us conclude that F(a,b) = b - floor(a/2).
- J0: AI analyzed functions individually and concluded F(a,b) = max(a,b) based on function composition and recursion.
- SC: 0
