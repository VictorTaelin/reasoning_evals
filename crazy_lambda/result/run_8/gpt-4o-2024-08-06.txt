#Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.

To analyze and simplify the given JavaScript functions, let's break down each function step by step:

1. **Function A**: 
   ```javascript
   A = x => u => v => u(x);
   ```
   - This is a curried function that takes three arguments: `x`, `u`, and `v`.
   - It returns the result of applying `u` to `x`, effectively ignoring `v`.

2. **Function B**: 
   ```javascript
   B = u => v => v;
   ```
   - This is a curried function that takes two arguments: `u` and `v`.
   - It returns `v`, effectively ignoring `u`.

3. **Function C**: 
   ```javascript
   C = x => x > 0 ? A(C(x-1)) : B;
   ```
   - This is a recursive function that constructs a nested application of `A` if `x` is greater than 0.
   - If `x` is 0 or less, it returns `B`.
   - Essentially, `C(x)` creates a chain of `A` applications of length `x`, ending with `B`.

4. **Function D**: 
   ```javascript
   D = x => x(y => 1+D(y))(0);
   ```
   - This function takes a function `x` and applies it to a function `y => 1 + D(y)`, starting with `0`.
   - It effectively computes the number of nested applications in `x` by counting how many times `y` is applied before reaching `0`.

5. **Function E**: 
   ```javascript
   E = a => a(b => b(c => x => x(y => E(c)(y))(x))(x => x))(x => x);
   ```
   - This function takes a function `a` and applies it to a series of transformations.
   - It essentially reduces the nested structure created by `C` to a simpler form, effectively counting the depth of the structure.

6. **Function F**: 
   ```javascript
   F = a => b => D(E(C(a))(C(b)));
   ```
   - This function combines the effects of `C`, `E`, and `D`.
   - `C(a)` and `C(b)` create two nested structures of `A` and `B`.
   - `E` simplifies these structures, and `D` counts the depth of the resulting structure.

### Simplified Formula for F

The function `F(a)(b)` effectively computes the minimum of `a` and `b`. Here's why:

- `C(a)` creates a structure of depth `a`.
- `C(b)` creates a structure of depth `b`.
- `E` combines these structures, and `D` counts the depth of the combined structure.
- The nature of the construction and reduction in `E` ensures that the depth counted by `D` is the minimum of the two depths.

Thus, the simplified formula for `F` is:

\[ F(a, b) = \min(a, b) \]

This means that `F` returns the smaller of the two numbers `a` and `b`.



RESULTS:

- Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.
- A0: By noticing A/B are Î»-Nat constructors, we can reconstruct E's pattern-matching structure, which lets us simplify it to E(a,b) = if a > 1 and b > 0 { E(a-2, b-1) } else { b }, which lets us conclude that F(a,b) = b - floor(a/2).
- J0: AI analyzed functions individually but incorrectly concluded F(a,b) = min(a,b)
- SC: 0
