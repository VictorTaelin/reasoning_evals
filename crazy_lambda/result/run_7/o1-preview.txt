#Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.

To analyze and explain each function, we'll interpret them step by step, mapping them to familiar concepts from lambda calculus and functional programming.

### **Function Definitions and Analysis**

**1. Function A:**
```javascript
A = x => u => v => u(x);
```
- **Interpretation:** This function resembles the **successor function** in Church numerals.
- **Behavior:** `A` takes an input `x` and two functions `u` and `v`. It applies `u` to `x`, essentially encapsulating the idea of incrementing or building upon `x`.

**2. Function B:**
```javascript
B = u => v => v;
```
- **Interpretation:** This function represents the **zero value** or **base case**.
- **Behavior:** `B` ignores the first argument `u` and returns the second argument `v`. This aligns with the behavior of `False` in lambda calculus, often used to represent zero.

**3. Function C:**
```javascript
C = x => x > 0 ? A(C(x - 1)) : B;
```
- **Interpretation:** This function constructs a **Church numeral** representing the number `x`.
- **Behavior:** It recursively builds up a number by nesting applications of `A`, starting from `B`. For example:
  - `C(0)` returns `B`.
  - `C(1)` returns `A(B)`.
  - `C(2)` returns `A(A(B))`.
- **Result:** `C(x)` represents a Church numeral for `x`, constructed via nested `A` functions applied to `B`.

**4. Function D:**
```javascript
D = x => x(y => 1 + D(y))(0);
```
- **Interpretation:** This function **evaluates** a Church numeral back to a JavaScript numerical value.
- **Behavior:** It applies a function that adds `1` to the result of `D(y)` recursively, starting from `0`. Essentially, it's computing the numerical value of a Church numeral.
- **Example:** If `x` is `C(n)`, then `D(x)` computes to `n`.

**5. Function E:**
```javascript
E = a => a(b => b(c => x => x(y => E(c)(y))(x))(x => x))(x => x);
```
- **Interpretation:** This function represents **exponentiation** in Church numerals.
- **Behavior:**
  - It takes a Church numeral `a` and returns a function.
  - This function, when applied to another Church numeral `b`, computes `b` raised to the power of `a`.
- **Mechanism:**
  - `E(C(a))(C(b))` computes \( b^a \) in terms of Church numerals.

**6. Function F:**
```javascript
F = a => b => D(E(C(a))(C(b)));
```
- **Interpretation:** This function computes \( b^a \).
- **Behavior:**
  - It constructs Church numerals for `a` and `b` using `C`.
  - It then computes the exponentiation using `E`.
  - Finally, it evaluates the result back to a numeric value using `D`.

### **Simplified Formula Equivalent to F**

After analyzing the functions, we find that:

- **`C(n)`** creates a Church numeral representing the integer `n`.
- **`D(C(n))`** evaluates the Church numeral back to the integer `n`.
- **`E(C(a))(C(b))`** computes the Church numeral for \( b^a \).
- **`D(E(C(a))(C(b)))`** evaluates the Church numeral \( b^a \) back to the integer \( b^a \).

Therefore, the simplified formula equivalent to `F` is:

\[
F(a, b) = b^a
\]

**Answer:**

An explicit formula: **F(a, b) = b to the power of a; that is, F(a, b) = bᵃ**



RESULTS:

- Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.
- A0: By noticing A/B are λ-Nat constructors, we can reconstruct E's pattern-matching structure, which lets us simplify it to E(a,b) = if a > 1 and b > 0 { E(a-2, b-1) } else { b }, which lets us conclude that F(a,b) = b - floor(a/2).
- J0: AI interpreted functions as Church numerals and exponentiation, concluding F(a,b) = b^a
