#Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.

What a delightful puzzle!

Let's break down each function:

**A**: `A = x => u => v => u(x)`

A is a higher-order function that takes three arguments: `x`, `u`, and `v`. It applies `u` to `x` and ignores `v`. In λ-Calculus, this is known as a "selector" or "projection" function, which selects the first argument (`x`) and applies a function (`u`) to it.

**B**: `B = u => v => v`

B is another higher-order function that takes two arguments: `u` and `v`. It ignores `u` and returns `v`. This is a "constant" function, which always returns its second argument.

**C**: `C = x => x > 0? A(C(x-1)) : B`

C is a recursive function that takes a single argument `x`. If `x` is greater than 0, it applies `A` to the result of `C(x-1)`. If `x` is 0 or less, it returns `B`. This function is building a nested structure of `A`s and `B`s, which will be important later.

**D**: `D = x => x(y => 1+D(y))(0)`

D is a recursive function that takes a single argument `x`. It applies `x` to a function that increments its argument by 1 and then applies `D` to the result. The `(0)` at the end is the initial value for the recursion. This function is essentially a "counter" that increments its argument by 1 until it reaches `x`.

**E**: `E = a => a(b=>b(c=>x=>x(y=>E(c)(y))(x))(x=>x))(x=>x)`

E is a higher-order function that takes a single argument `a`. It applies `a` to a complex function that involves multiple nested applications of `E` itself. This function is a "fixed-point combinator," which is a way of implementing recursion without explicit function calls.

**F**: `F = a => b => D(E(C(a))(C(b)))`

F is the final function, which takes two arguments `a` and `b`. It applies `D` to the result of applying `E` to the results of applying `C` to `a` and `b`, respectively.

Now, let's simplify F.

Notice that `C(x)` builds a nested structure of `A`s and `B`s, where the number of `A`s is equal to `x`. When `x` is 0, `C(x)` returns `B`.

`E` is a fixed-point combinator, which means it can be used to implement recursion. In this case, `E` is used to "unfold" the nested structure built by `C`.

`D` is a counter that increments its argument by 1 until it reaches `x`.

Putting it all together, we can see that `F(a, b)` is equivalent to `a + b`.

Here's a simplified formula:

`F(a, b) = a + b`

In other words, the obfuscated function F is simply adding its two arguments together.

Well, that was a fun puzzle!



RESULTS:

- Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.
- A0: By noticing A/B are λ-Nat constructors, we can reconstruct E's pattern-matching structure, which lets us simplify it to E(a,b) = if a > 1 and b > 0 { E(a-2, b-1) } else { b }, which lets us conclude that F(a,b) = b - floor(a/2).
- J0: AI analyzed each function but incorrectly concluded F(a,b) = a + b, missing the λ-Nat structure and E's pattern-matching.
- SC: 0
