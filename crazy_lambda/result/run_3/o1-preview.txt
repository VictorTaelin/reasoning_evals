#Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.

To analyze and explain each function, let's delve into them step by step:

**1. Function `A`**:

```javascript
A = x => u => v => u(x);
```

This is a curried function that takes:

- An argument `x`.
- A function `u`.
- A function `v`.

It returns the result of applying `u` to `x`, effectively `u(x)`. This function helps build up the Church numerals by nesting applications of `u`.

**2. Function `B`**:

```javascript
B = u => v => v;
```

This function takes two arguments `u` and `v` and simply returns `v`. It serves as the base case in the creation of Church numerals, representing the numeral zero.

**3. Function `C`**:

```javascript
C = x => x > 0 ? A(C(x-1)) : B;
```

This is a recursive function that constructs Church numerals:

- If `x > 0`, it constructs the successor of the Church numeral for `x - 1` by applying `A` to `C(x - 1)`.
- If `x == 0`, it returns `B`, representing zero.

Effectively, `C(n)` constructs the Church numeral for the integer `n`. In lambda calculus, Church numerals represent non-negative integers using functions.

**4. Function `D`**:

```javascript
D = x => x(y => 1+D(y))(0);
```

This function converts a Church numeral back into a JavaScript number:

- It applies the Church numeral `x` to the function `y => 1 + D(y)` and the initial value `0`.
- This recursively adds `1` for each application, effectively calculating the integer value of the Church numeral.

**5. Function `E`**:

```javascript
E = a => a(b => b(c => x => x(y => E(c)(y))(x))(x => x))(x => x);
```

This complex recursive function performs exponentiation on Church numerals:

- It applies the Church numeral `a` to a function that takes a Church numeral `b` and returns a function representing `E(c)`.
- It builds up the exponentiation by recursively applying functions, following the exponentiation logic in lambda calculus: `EXP = λm.λn.n(m)`.

**6. Function `F`**:

```javascript
F = a => b => D(E(C(a))(C(b)));
```

Here, `F` takes two numbers `a` and `b`:

- It constructs the Church numerals for `a` and `b` using `C(a)` and `C(b)`.
- It computes the exponentiation of these Church numerals using `E(C(a))(C(b))`, resulting in a Church numeral for `a^b`.
- It converts the resulting Church numeral back into a JavaScript number using `D`, so `D(E(C(a))(C(b)))`.

**Simplified Formula Equivalent to `F`**:

Combining all the functions and their purposes, we see that `F(a)(b)` computes `a` raised to the power of `b`. Therefore, the simplified formula equivalent to `F` is:

```javascript
F(a)(b) = a ** b;  // or equivalently, F(a)(b) = Math.pow(a, b)
```

This means that despite the obfuscation using lambda calculus techniques, the function `F` ultimately computes exponentiation.

**Answer:**

An explicit formula: F(a)(b) = a to the b power; that is, F(a, b) = aᵇ



RESULTS:

- Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.
- A0: By noticing A/B are λ-Nat constructors, we can reconstruct E's pattern-matching structure, which lets us simplify it to E(a,b) = if a > 1 and b > 0 { E(a-2, b-1) } else { b }, which lets us conclude that F(a,b) = b - floor(a/2).
- J0: AI analyzed functions as Church numerals and lambda calculus, concluding F computes exponentiation.
- SC: 0
