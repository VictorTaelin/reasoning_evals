#Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.



What a delightful example of obfuscated code!

Let's break down each function step by step:

**A**: `A = x => u => v => u(x)`

A is a higher-order function that takes three arguments: `x`, `u`, and `v`. It applies `u` to `x` and ignores `v`. In essence, A is a function that applies its second argument to its first argument.

**B**: `B = u => v => v`

B is a simple function that takes two arguments, `u` and `v`, and returns `v`. It ignores `u` entirely. B is essentially the identity function for its second argument.

**C**: `C = x => x > 0 ? A(C(x-1)) : B`

C is a recursive function that takes a single argument `x`. If `x` is greater than 0, it applies A to the result of calling C with `x-1`. If `x` is 0 or less, it returns B. This function is building a nested chain of A's, with the number of A's determined by the value of `x`.

**D**: `D = x => x(y => 1+D(y))(0)`

D is another recursive function that takes a single argument `x`. It applies `x` to a function that increments its argument by 1 and then calls D with that new value. The initial value passed to this function is 0. This function is essentially a mechanism for counting the number of times `x` can be applied before reaching 0.

**E**: `E = a => a(b=>b(c=>x=>x(y=>E(c)(y))(x))(x=>x))(x=>x)`

E is a mind-bending function that takes a single argument `a`. It's difficult to decipher, but it appears to be a fixed-point combinator, which is a way of implementing recursion without explicit function calls. E is used to create a recursive function from a non-recursive one.

**F**: `F = a => b => D(E(C(a))(C(b)))`

F is the final function, which takes two arguments `a` and `b`. It applies D to the result of applying E to the results of applying C to `a` and `b`, respectively.

Now, let's simplify F.

After analyzing the functions, we can see that:

* C is building a chain of A's, which is equivalent to creating a function that applies its argument `x` times.
* E is a fixed-point combinator that creates a recursive function from a non-recursive one.
* D is a counting function that increments its argument until it reaches 0.

With these insights, we can simplify F as follows:

F(a, b) = D(E(C(a))(C(b)))
= D(E(x => x^a)(x => x^b)) (where x^a represents the function that applies x, a times)
= D(x => x^(a+b))
= a + b

So, the simplified formula equivalent to F is:

F(a, b) = a + b

In other words, F simply adds its two arguments together.



RESULTS:

- Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.
- A0: By noticing A/B are λ-Nat constructors, we can reconstruct E's pattern-matching structure, which lets us simplify it to E(a,b) = if a > 1 and b > 0 { E(a-2, b-1) } else { b }, which lets us conclude that F(a,b) = b - floor(a/2).
- J0: AI analyzed each function but incorrectly concluded F(a,b) = a + b, missing the λ-Nat structure and E's pattern-matching.
- SC: 0
