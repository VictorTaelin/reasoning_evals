#Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.

What a delightful example of obfuscated code!

Let's break down each function step by step:

**A**:
`A = x => u => v => u(x);`

A is a higher-order function that takes three arguments: `x`, `u`, and `v`. It applies `u` to `x` and ignores `v`. In essence, A is a function that applies its second argument to its first argument.

**B**:
`B = u => v => v;`

B is a simple function that takes two arguments, `u` and `v`, and returns `v`. It ignores its first argument, `u`.

**C**:
`C = x => x > 0? A(C(x-1)) : B;`

C is a recursive function that takes a single argument, `x`. If `x` is greater than 0, it applies A to the result of calling C with `x-1`. If `x` is 0 or less, it returns B.

In other words, C is a function that recursively applies A to itself `x` times, and then returns B when `x` reaches 0.

**D**:
`D = x => x(y => 1+D(y))(0);`

D is a function that takes a single argument, `x`. It applies `x` to a function that takes `y` and returns `1 + D(y)`, and then applies the result to 0.

This is a clever way of implementing a recursive function that calculates the sum of all integers from 0 to `x`.

**E**:
`E = a => a(b=>b(c=>x=>x(y=>E(c)(y))(x))(x=>x))(x=>x);`

E is a mind-bending function that takes a single argument, `a`. It's a higher-order function that applies `a` to a complex function that involves multiple levels of recursion.

After some careful analysis, it appears that E is a function that takes a function `a` and returns a new function that applies `a` to itself recursively.

**F**:
`F = a => b => D(E(C(a))(C(b)));`

F is the final function that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`. It applies D to the result of applying E to the result of applying C to `a` and `b`.

Now, let's simplify F.

After analyzing each function, we can see that:

* C is a recursive function that applies A to itself `x` times.
* E is a function that takes a function `a` and returns a new function that applies `a` to itself recursively.
* D is a function that calculates the sum of all integers from 0 to `x`.

With these insights, we can simplify F as follows:

F(a, b) = D(E(C(a))(C(b)))
= D(E(A^a)(A^b)) (where A^x means applying A to itself x times)
= D(A^(a+b)) (since E(A^a) returns a new function that applies A to itself a times, and then b times)
= sum of all integers from 0 to a+b

Therefore, the simplified formula for F is:

F(a, b) = (a + b) * (a + b + 1) / 2

This formula calculates the sum of all integers from 0 to a+b, which is equivalent to the original function F.



RESULTS:

- Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.
- A0: By noticing A/B are Î»-Nat constructors, we can reconstruct E's pattern-matching structure, which lets us simplify it to E(a,b) = if a > 1 and b > 0 { E(a-2, b-1) } else { b }, which lets us conclude that F(a,b) = b - floor(a/2).
- J0: AI analyzed each function but misinterpreted their purpose, leading to an incorrect simplification of F.
- SC: 0
