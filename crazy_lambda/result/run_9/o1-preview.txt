#Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.

To analyze and simplify the given JavaScript functions, we'll delve into how they're constructed and what they represent, especially in the context of lambda calculus and Church numerals.

**Function A:**

```javascript
A = x => u => v => u(x);
```

- **Interpretation:** `A` is a higher-order function that takes an argument `x` and returns a function that takes `u` and `v`, ultimately returning `u(x)`.
- **In Lambda Calculus:** This resembles the successor function for Church numerals, which increments a numeral by one.

**Function B:**

```javascript
B = u => v => v;
```

- **Interpretation:** `B` is a constant function that ignores its first argument `u` and returns its second argument `v`.
- **In Lambda Calculus:** This corresponds to the Church numeral zero, which essentially returns the initial value without applying any function.

**Function C:**

```javascript
C = x => x > 0 ? A(C(x - 1)) : B;
```

- **Interpretation:** `C` recursively constructs Church numerals. If `x > 0`, it applies the successor function `A` to `C(x - 1)`, otherwise, it returns `B`.
- **In Lambda Calculus:** `C(n)` represents the Church numeral for the integer `n`, constructed by applying the successor function `n` times to zero.

**Function D:**

```javascript
D = x => x(y => 1 + D(y))(0);
```

- **Interpretation:** `D` is an evaluator that computes the integer value of a given Church numeral.
- **In Lambda Calculus:** This function applies the numeral to a function that increments a counter, effectively converting a Church numeral back to a JavaScript number.

**Function E:**

```javascript
E = a => a(b => b(c => x => x(y => E(c)(y))(x))(x => x))(x => x);
```

- **Interpretation:** `E` performs exponentiation on Church numerals.
- **In Lambda Calculus:** This mirrors the exponentiation operation for Church numerals, where exponentiation is defined as `E(m)(n) = n m`.

**Function F:**

```javascript
F = a => b => D(E(C(a))(C(b)));
```

- **Interpretation:** `F` computes the exponentiation of two natural numbers `a` and `b`. It first converts both numbers into Church numerals using `C`, then exponentiates them using `E`, and finally evaluates the result back to a JavaScript number using `D`.
- **Simplified Formula:** `F(a, b) = a ** b` (where `**` denotes exponentiation).

**Putting It All Together:**

1. **Conversion to Church Numerals:** `C(a)` and `C(b)` convert JavaScript numbers `a` and `b` into their corresponding Church numerals.
2. **Exponentiation:** `E(C(a))(C(b))` computes the exponentiation of the two Church numerals, effectively representing `a` raised to the power of `b` in Church numeral form.
3. **Evaluation:** `D(...)` evaluates the resulting Church numeral back into a JavaScript number.

**Final Simplified Formula:**

```javascript
F(a, b) = a ** b;
```

This means the function `F` calculates `a` raised to the power `b`.

**Answer:**

An explicit formula: **F(a, b) = a ᵇ** (that is, F computes the exponentiation of a and b)



RESULTS:

- Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.
- A0: By noticing A/B are λ-Nat constructors, we can reconstruct E's pattern-matching structure, which lets us simplify it to E(a,b) = if a > 1 and b > 0 { E(a-2, b-1) } else { b }, which lets us conclude that F(a,b) = b - floor(a/2).
- J0: AI analyzed functions as Church numerals and concluded F(a,b) = a^b, missing the actual pattern-matching structure.
- SC: 0
