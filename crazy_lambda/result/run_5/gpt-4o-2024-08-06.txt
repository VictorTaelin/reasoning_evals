#Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.

To analyze and explain each function, let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Function A**: 
   ```javascript
   A = x => u => v => u(x);
   ```
   - This function takes three arguments: `x`, `u`, and `v`.
   - It returns the result of applying the function `u` to the argument `x`.
   - Essentially, it ignores `v` and applies `u` to `x`.

2. **Function B**:
   ```javascript
   B = u => v => v;
   ```
   - This function takes two arguments: `u` and `v`.
   - It returns `v`, effectively ignoring `u`.

3. **Function C**:
   ```javascript
   C = x => x > 0 ? A(C(x-1)) : B;
   ```
   - This is a recursive function that takes a number `x`.
   - If `x` is greater than 0, it returns a function that is the result of `A` applied to `C(x-1)`.
   - If `x` is 0 or less, it returns `B`.
   - This function constructs a nested application of `A` functions, with `B` as the base case.

4. **Function D**:
   ```javascript
   D = x => x(y => 1+D(y))(0);
   ```
   - This function takes a function `x` and applies it to a function `y => 1 + D(y)`, then applies the result to `0`.
   - It effectively counts the number of times `x` can be applied to `y => 1 + D(y)` before reaching a base case.

5. **Function E**:
   ```javascript
   E = a => a(b => b(c => x => x(y => E(c)(y))(x))(x => x))(x => x);
   ```
   - This function takes a function `a` and applies it to a complex function.
   - The inner workings involve recursive applications and are designed to traverse the structure created by `C`.

6. **Function F**:
   ```javascript
   F = a => b => D(E(C(a))(C(b)));
   ```
   - This function takes two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - It constructs two structures using `C(a)` and `C(b)`.
   - It applies `E` to these structures and then applies `D` to the result.

### Simplified Explanation and Formula

The functions `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and `E` are designed to simulate operations on Church numerals, which are a way to represent natural numbers using functions in lambda calculus. Here's how they work together:

- **C(x)**: Constructs a Church numeral representation of the number `x`.
- **E**: Combines two Church numerals using a multiplication-like operation.
- **D**: Converts a Church numeral back to a JavaScript number by counting the number of applications.

Therefore, the function `F(a)(b)` effectively computes the product of `a` and `b` using Church numerals. 

### Simplified Formula

The simplified formula equivalent to `F` is:

\[ F(a, b) = a \times b \]

This means that `F` takes two numbers `a` and `b` and returns their product.



RESULTS:

- Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.
- A0: By noticing A/B are λ-Nat constructors, we can reconstruct E's pattern-matching structure, which lets us simplify it to E(a,b) = if a > 1 and b > 0 { E(a-2, b-1) } else { b }, which lets us conclude that F(a,b) = b - floor(a/2).
- J0: AI interpreted functions as Church numerals, concluding F(a,b) = a × b
- SC: 0
