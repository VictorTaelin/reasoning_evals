#Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.

To solve this problem, we need to analyze each function step by step and understand how they work together. 

First, let's re-express the functions in more familiar terms:

1. **Function A**:  
   ```javascript
   A = x => u => v => u(x);
   ```
   **Interpretation**: A function that takes an argument `x`, then functions `u` and `v`, and applies `u` to `x`.

2. **Function B**:  
   ```javascript
   B = u => v => v;
   ```
   **Interpretation**: A function that ignores `u` and returns `v`.

3. **Function C**:
   ```javascript
   C = x => x > 0 ? A(C(x-1)) : B;
   ```
   **Interpretation**: A recursive function that builds up a structure by applying `A` `x` times to `B`. When `x` is 0, it returns `B`.

4. **Function D**:
   ```javascript
   D = x => x(y => 1 + D(y))(0);
   ```
   **Interpretation**: A function that computes the depth or length of the structure generated by `C`. It recursively counts how many times it can apply the function `y => 1 + D(y)` starting from `x` before reaching the base case.

5. **Function E**:
   ```javascript
   E = a => a(b => b(c => x => x(y => E(c)(y))(x))(x => x))(x => x);
   ```
   **Interpretation**: A function that performs an operation that resembles addition. It recursively combines two structures generated by `C`.

6. **Function F**:
   ```javascript
   F = a => b => D(E(C(a))(C(b)));
   ```
   **Interpretation**: A function that takes two numbers `a` and `b`, constructs structures using `C`, combines them with `E`, and computes the length with `D`.

**Simplifying the functions:**

- **Function `C(n)` represents a structure with `n` elements.**
- **Function `D(C(n))` computes the number `n`.**
- **Function `E(C(a))(C(b))` combines the structures of `C(a)` and `C(b)` into a new structure `C(a + b)`.**
  
Therefore, **Function `F(a)(b)` computes the sum of `a` and `b`**.

**Simplified Formula:**

```plaintext
F(a)(b) = a + b
```



RESULTS:

- Q0: Analyze and explain each function. Then, write a simplified formula that is equivalent to F.
- A0: By noticing A/B are Î»-Nat constructors, we can reconstruct E's pattern-matching structure, which lets us simplify it to E(a,b) = if a > 1 and b > 0 { E(a-2, b-1) } else { b }, which lets us conclude that F(a,b) = b - floor(a/2).
- J0: AI analyzed each function and concluded F(a)(b) computes the sum of a and b.
- SC: 0
