Let an AB symbol be one of 4 possible variants:

  data AB : Set where
    A# : AB
    #A : AB
    B# : AB
    #B : AB

Let an AB Term be a list of AB symbols:

  Term : Set = List AB

An AB system computes via the following step reduction relation:

  data _=>_ : List AB → List AB → Set where
    comm-AB : ∀ xs → (A# ∷ #B ∷ xs) => (#B ∷ A# ∷ xs)
    comm-BA : ∀ xs → (B# ∷ #A ∷ xs) => (#A ∷ B# ∷ xs)
    anni-AA : ∀ xs → (A# ∷ #A ∷ xs) => xs
    anni-BB : ∀ xs → (B# ∷ #B ∷ xs) => xs

An AB term is in normal form if it can't be reduced further.

For example, the normal form of the term below can be computed in 3 steps:

  B# A# #B #A B#
  -------------- comm-AB
  B# #B A# #А B#
  -------------- anni-BB
  A# #А B#
  -------- anni-AA
  B#

Note that a pair only interacts when the '#' is internal.
For example, 'A# #A' interacts, but '#A A#' does not.

Your goal is to answer logical questions about this system. Can we start?

Absolutely, I'm ready to help you with questions about the AB system. Feel free to ask whatever you'd like to explore or clarify!

#Q0: What's the normal form of `#A A# #B A# A# B# B# #A #B B# #A B# #B`?

To determine the normal form of the AB term `#A A# #B A# A# B# B# #A #B B# #A B# #B`, we'll systematically apply the reduction rules until no further reductions are possible.

### Initial Term:
```
#A A# #B A# A# B# B# #A #B B# #A B# #B
```

### Step-by-Step Reductions:

1. **Apply `comm-AB` to `A# #B`**:
   ```
   #A #B A# A# B# B# #A #B B# #A B# #B
   ```

2. **Apply `comm-BA` to `B# #A`**:
   ```
   #A #B A# A# #A B# B# #B B# #A B# #B
   ```

3. **Apply `anni-AA` to `A# #A`**:
   ```
   #A #B B# B# #B B# #A B# #B
   ```

4. **Apply `anni-BB` to `B# #B`**:
   ```
   #A #B B# #A B# #B
   ```

5. **Apply `comm-BA` to `B# #A`**:
   ```
   #A #B #A B# #B
   ```

6. **Apply `anni-AA` to `A# #A`**:
   ```
   #A #B B#
   ```

### Normal Form:
After all possible reductions, the normal form of the term is:
```
#A #B B#
```

This is the simplest form of the original term, where no further reduction rules apply.

#Q1: Is the AB system strongly normalizing?

Yes, the **AB system** is **strongly normalizing**. This means that every sequence of reduction steps in the AB system will eventually terminate in a normal form, ensuring there are no infinite reduction paths.

### **Understanding Strong Normalization in the AB System**

To establish that the AB system is strongly normalizing, let's analyze its reduction rules and their implications:

1. **Reduction Rules Overview:**
   - **Commutation Rules:**
     - `comm-AB`: Swaps `A#` and `#B` to `#B` and `A#`.
     - `comm-BA`: Swaps `B#` and `#A` to `#A` and `B#`.
   - **Annihilation Rules:**
     - `anni-AA`: Eliminates the pair `A# #A`.
     - `anni-BB`: Eliminates the pair `B# #B`.

2. **Potential for Infinite Reductions:**
   - **Commutation Loops:** At first glance, one might worry that the commutation rules could create cycles, allowing perpetual swapping without making progress towards a normal form.
   - **Annihilation Mechanism:** However, the annihilation rules play a crucial role in preventing infinite loops. They systematically reduce the length of the term by eliminating pairs, ensuring that the overall structure of the term decreases over time.

3. **Termination Argument:**
   - **Measure Decrease:** Assigning a well-founded measure (like the length of the list or a specific ordering of symbols) ensures that each reduction step brings the term closer to termination.
   - **No Growth Mechanism:** The system lacks rules that can indefinitely increase the size or complexity of the term, eliminating the possibility of infinite expansion.
   - **Finite Possibilities:** Given that each reduction either rearranges symbols towards a normal form or eliminates pairs, the number of possible unique terms is finite relative to the reduction steps taken.

4. **Confluence and Normalization:**
   - **Confluence:** While the primary focus is on strong normalization, the AB system also exhibits properties that prevent divergent paths, further supporting termination.
   - **Normalization:** Every term has at least one normal form, and due to strong normalization, all reduction paths are guaranteed to reach some normal form without endless progression.

### **Conclusion**

The combination of **commutation** and **annihilation** in the AB system ensures that every possible reduction sequence will invariably lead to a normal form. There are no infinite loops or endlessly increasing terms, which solidifies the strong normalization property of the AB system.

**Therefore, the AB system is indeed strongly normalizing.**

#Q2: In a normalized term starting with `#A B#`, which symbols can occur afterwards?

Certainly! Let's delve into **#Q2**:

### **#Q2: In a normalized term starting with `#A B#`, which symbols can occur afterwards?**

#### **Understanding the AB System Constraints**

To determine which symbols can follow `#A B#` in a **normalized term**, we need to consider the **reduction rules** that define the AB system:

1. **Commutation Rules:**
   - `comm-AB`: Swaps `A#` and `#B` to `#B A#`.
   - `comm-BA`: Swaps `B#` and `#A` to `#A B#`.

2. **Annihilation Rules:**
   - `anni-AA`: Eliminates `A# #A`.
   - `anni-BB`: Eliminates `B# #B`.

A **normalized term** is one where **no further reduction rules can be applied**. This means:

- **No adjacent pair** of symbols should match any of the patterns in the reduction rules.
- Specifically, **no `A# #A` or `B# #B` pairs** should exist.
- **Commutation pairs** (`A# #B` or `B# #A`) should not be present to ensure the term is already in its simplest form.

#### **Analyzing the Prefix `#A B#`**

Given the term starts with `#A B#`, let's examine the potential symbols that can follow `B#` without introducing reducible pairs.

1. **Possible AB Symbols:**
   - `A#`
   - `#A`
   - `B#`
   - `#B`

2. **Evaluating Each Possibility After `B#`:**

   - **`A#`**:
     - **Pair:** `B# A#`
     - **Reduction Potential:** 
       - No direct reduction applies since `B# A#` does not match any reduction pattern.
     - **Status:** **Allowed** in normalized term.

   - **`#A`**:
     - **Pair:** `B# #A`
     - **Reduction Potential:**
       - Matches `comm-BA`: `B# #A` can be reduced to `#A B#`.
     - **Status:** **Not allowed** in normalized term (would lead to reduction).

   - **`B#`**:
     - **Pair:** `B# B#`
     - **Reduction Potential:**
       - Does **not** directly match any reduction pattern (`anni-BB` specifically targets `B# #B`).
     - **Status:** **Allowed** in normalized term.

   - **`#B`**:
     - **Pair:** `B# #B`
     - **Reduction Potential:**
       - Matches `anni-BB`: `B# #B` can be reduced by eliminating both symbols.
     - **Status:** **Not allowed** in normalized term (would lead to reduction).

#### **Conclusion: Permissible Symbols After `#A B#`**

Based on the above analysis:

- **Allowed Symbols After `#A B#`:**
  - `A#`
  - `B#`

- **Disallowed Symbols After `#A B#`:**
  - `#A`
  - `#B`

This ensures that the term remains in **normal form** with no further reductions possible.

#### **Example:**

- **Valid Normalized Term Starting with `#A B#`:**
  ```
  #A B# A# B# A# B#
  ```
  - **Explanation:** Each adjacent pair (`#A B#`, `B# A#`, `A# B#`, etc.) does not trigger any reduction rules.

- **Invalid Normalized Term Starting with `#A B#`:**
  ```
  #A B# #A B#
  ```
  - **Explanation:** The pair `B# #A` can be reduced via `comm-BA`, so the term is **not** in normal form.

### **Final Answer**

**In any normal form term that begins with `#A B#`, only `A#` or `B#` may immediately follow.** Thus, the symbols that can occur after `#A B#` are:

- `A#`
- `B#`

This ensures that no further reduction rules are applicable, maintaining the term's normalized state.

#Q3: In a normalized term starting with `A#`, which symbols can NOT occur afterwards?

Certainly! Let's analyze **#Q3** in detail.

---

### **#Q3: In a normalized term starting with `A#`, which symbols can NOT occur afterwards?**

#### **Understanding the AB System Constraints**

To determine which symbols **cannot** follow `A#` in a **normalized term**, we need to consider the **reduction rules** of the AB system:

1. **Commutation Rules:**
   - `comm-AB`: Swaps `A#` and `#B` to `#B` and `A#`.
     \[
     A# \; \#B \Rightarrow \#B \; A#
     \]
   - `comm-BA`: Swaps `B#` and `#A` to `#A` and `B#`.
     \[
     B# \; \#A \Rightarrow \#A \; B#
     \]

2. **Annihilation Rules:**
   - `anni-AA`: Eliminates the pair `A# #A`.
     \[
     A# \; \#A \Rightarrow \text{(removed)}
     \]
   - `anni-BB`: Eliminates the pair `B# #B`.
     \[
     B# \; \#B \Rightarrow \text{(removed)}
     \]

#### **Possible Symbols After `A#`**

The AB symbols are:
- `A#`
- `#A`
- `B#`
- `#B`

When a term starts with `A#`, the **second symbol** determines whether the term is in normal form. Let's analyze each possibility:

1. **`A# A#`**
   - **Pair:** `A# A#`
   - **Reduction Potential:** 
     - **No reduction rule applies** directly to this pair.
   - **Status:** **Allowed** in normalized term.

2. **`A# #A`**
   - **Pair:** `A# #A`
   - **Reduction Potential:**
     - Matches `anni-AA`: `A# #A` can be reduced by eliminating both symbols.
   - **Status:** **Not allowed** in normalized term (would lead to reduction).

3. **`A# B#`**
   - **Pair:** `A# B#`
   - **Reduction Potential:**
     - **No reduction rule applies** directly to this pair.
   - **Status:** **Allowed** in normalized term.

4. **`A# #B`**
   - **Pair:** `A# #B`
   - **Reduction Potential:**
     - Matches `comm-AB`: `A# #B` can be commuted to `#B A#`.
   - **Status:** **Not allowed** in normalized term (would lead to reduction).

#### **Conclusion: Symbols That Cannot Follow `A#`**

Based on the analysis:

- **Disallowed Symbols After `A#`:**
  - `#A`
  - `#B`

These symbols would create reducible pairs (`A# #A` and `A# #B`), meaning their presence would violate the term's normal form.

- **Allowed Symbols After `A#`:**
  - `A#`
  - `B#`

These pairs (`A# A#` and `A# B#`) do **not** trigger any reduction rules and thus maintain the term's normalized state.

#### **Final Answer**

**In any normalized term that begins with `A#`, the symbols `#A` and `#B` cannot immediately follow `A#`.** Therefore, the symbols that **cannot** occur after `A#` in a normalized term are:

- `#A`
- `#B`

---

**Example Illustrations:**

- **Valid Normalized Term Starting with `A#`:**
  ```
  A# B# A# A# B#
  ```
  - **Explanation:** Each adjacent pair (`A# B#`, `B# A#`, `A# A#`, etc.) does not trigger any reduction rules.

- **Invalid Normalized Term Starting with `A#`:**
  ```
  A# #A B# #B
  ```
  - **Explanation:** 
    - `A# #A` can be reduced via `anni-AA`, and 
    - `B# #B` can be reduced via `anni-BB`. 
    - Hence, the term is **not** in normal form.

---

**Summary:**

- **Cannot Follow `A#`:** `#A`, `#B`
- **Can Follow `A#`:** `A#`, `B#`

This ensures that the term remains in **normal form** with no further reductions possible.

#Q4: This system is strongly normalizing. Would allowing only inputs with a single letter type make it non-normalizing?

Certainly! Let's delve into **#Q4** to understand the implications of restricting the AB system to inputs with a single letter type.

---

### **#Q4: This system is strongly normalizing. Would allowing only inputs with a single letter type make it non-normalizing?**

#### **Understanding the AB System and Strong Normalization**

1. **AB System Recap:**
   - **Symbols:** The AB system consists of four symbols:
     - `A#`
     - `#A`
     - `B#`
     - `#B`
   - **Reduction Rules:**
     - **Commutation Rules:**
       - `comm-AB`: Swaps `A#` and `#B` to `#B` and `A#`.
         \[
         A# \; \#B \Rightarrow \#B \; A#
         \]
       - `comm-BA`: Swaps `B#` and `#A` to `#A` and `B#`.
         \[
         B# \; \#A \Rightarrow \#A \; B#
         \]
     - **Annihilation Rules:**
       - `anni-AA`: Eliminates the pair `A# #A`.
         \[
         A# \; \#A \Rightarrow \text{(removed)}
         \]
       - `anni-BB`: Eliminates the pair `B# #B`.
         \[
         B# \; \#B \Rightarrow \text{(removed)}
         \]

2. **Strong Normalization:**
   - A system is **strongly normalizing** if **every** sequence of reduction steps terminates in a normal form (i.e., no infinite reduction paths exist).

#### **Restricting to a Single Letter Type**

**Interpretation:**
- **Single Letter Type Restriction:** Allowing only symbols related to **one** letter type (either only `A` symbols or only `B` symbols), but not both simultaneously.
  - **Case 1:** Only `A#` and `#A` are allowed.
  - **Case 2:** Only `B#` and `#B` are allowed.

**Analyzing Each Case:**

1. **Case 1: Only `A#` and `#A` Allowed**
   - **Relevant Reduction Rules:**
     - `anni-AA`: 
       \[
       A# \; \#A \Rightarrow \text{(removed)}
       \]
   - **Possible Reductions:**
     - The only applicable reduction is `anni-AA`, which removes pairs of `A#` and `#A`.
   - **Behavior:**
     - **Termination:** Each reduction step **strictly decreases** the length of the term by two symbols.
     - **No Other Rules Apply:** Since `B#` and `#B` are absent, commutation rules are irrelevant.
     - **Conclusion:** The system remains **strongly normalizing** because each reduction step moves towards an empty term or a term with no reducible pairs.

2. **Case 2: Only `B#` and `#B` Allowed**
   - **Relevant Reduction Rules:**
     - `anni-BB`: 
       \[
       B# \; \#B \Rightarrow \text{(removed)}
       \]
   - **Possible Reductions:**
     - The only applicable reduction is `anni-BB`, which removes pairs of `B#` and `#B`.
   - **Behavior:**
     - **Termination:** Each reduction step **strictly decreases** the length of the term by two symbols.
     - **No Other Rules Apply:** Since `A#` and `#A` are absent, commutation rules are irrelevant.
     - **Conclusion:** The system remains **strongly normalizing** because each reduction step moves towards an empty term or a term with no reducible pairs.

#### **Why Strong Normalization Is Preserved**

1. **Limited Reduction Rules:**
   - With only one letter type, only **annihilation rules** are applicable. There are no **commutation rules** that could potentially reorder symbols indefinitely.

2. **Decreasing Measure:**
   - Each annihilation step reduces the term length by two symbols. This creates a **well-founded measure** (term length) that strictly decreases with each reduction step, ensuring termination.

3. **Absence of Growth Mechanisms:**
   - There are no rules that **add** symbols or allow **reordering** without progress towards reduction, preventing infinite loops.

4. **Finite Reduction Paths:**
   - Since each reduction step reduces the term size and there's a finite number of symbols, every sequence of reductions must eventually terminate.

#### **Potential Misconceptions Addressed**

- **Infinite Reduction Paths:** 
  - **Concern:** One might worry that without commutation rules, the system could enter an infinite loop.
  - **Reality:** In the single letter type restriction, only annihilation applies, which **always decreases** term size, preventing infinite loops.

- **System Complexity:**
  - **Concern:** Restricting to a single letter type might simplify the system to the point where unexpected behaviors emerge.
  - **Reality:** The system remains straightforward, with predictable reductions ensuring termination.

#### **Final Conclusion**

**Restricting the AB system to inputs containing only a single letter type (either exclusively `A` symbols or exclusively `B` symbols) does not compromise its strong normalization property.** The system remains **strongly normalizing** because each reduction step inexorably reduces the term's complexity, guaranteeing termination.

---

### **Summary**

- **Original AB System:** Strongly normalizing with both `A` and `B` symbols due to interplay between commutation and annihilation rules.
- **Single Letter Type Restriction:** 
  - **Allowed Symbols:** Either only `A#` and `#A` **or** only `B#` and `#B`.
  - **Reduction Rules:** Only corresponding annihilation rules (`anni-AA` or `anni-BB`).
  - **Normalization:** Maintains strong normalization, ensuring all reduction sequences terminate.

If you have any further questions or need more clarifications on the AB system, feel free to ask!

#Q5: This system is strongly normalizing. Would introducing the `swap-AB` rule: `#A B# => B# #A` make it non-normalizing?

Introducing the `swap-AB` rule `#A B# => B# #A` to the AB system poses significant implications for its normalization properties. Let's analyze whether this modification affects the system's **strong normalization**—a property ensuring that every reduction sequence terminates in a normal form without infinite loops.

---

### **Understanding the AB System and Strong Normalization**

1. **Original AB System:**
   
   - **Symbols:**
     - `A#`
     - `#A`
     - `B#`
     - `#B`
   
   - **Reduction Rules:**
     1. **Commutation Rules:**
        - `comm-AB`: 
          \[
          A# \; \#B \Rightarrow \#B \; A#
          \]
        - `comm-BA`: 
          \[
          B# \; \#A \Rightarrow \#A \; B#
          \]
     2. **Annihilation Rules:**
        - `anni-AA`: 
          \[
          A# \; \#A \Rightarrow \text{(removed)}
          \]
        - `anni-BB`: 
          \[
          B# \; \#B \Rightarrow \text{(removed)}
          \]

   - **Strong Normalization:** Ensured by the combinatory nature of the commutation and annihilation rules, preventing infinite reduction sequences.

2. **Proposed Modification:**
   
   - **New Reduction Rule:**
     - `swap-AB`: 
       \[
       \#A \; B# \Rightarrow B# \; \#A
       \]
   
   - **Objective:** Assess whether adding `swap-AB` disrupts the system's strong normalization.

---

### **Analyzing the Impact of `swap-AB`**

#### **Potential for Infinite Reduction Sequences**

To determine if `swap-AB` introduces the possibility of infinite reductions, consider the following term:

\[
\#A \; B# \; \#A \; B# \; \#A \; B# \; \dots
\]

**Reduction Steps:**

1. **Apply `swap-AB` to `#A B#`:**
   \[
   \#A \; B# \Rightarrow B# \; \#A
   \]
   Resulting Term:
   \[
   B# \; \#A \; \#A \; B# \; \#A \; B# \; \dots
   \]

2. **Apply `comm-BA` to `B# \; \#A`:**
   \[
   B# \; \#A \Rightarrow \#A \; B#
   \]
   Resulting Term:
   \[
   \#A \; B# \; \#A \; B# \; \#A \; B# \; \dots
   \]

**Observation:**

- **Cycle Formation:** The term oscillates between `#A B# ...` and `B# #A ...` without progressing towards a normal form.
- **Infinite Loop:** The reduction steps can repeat indefinitely:
  \[
  \#A \; B# \Rightarrow B# \; \#A \Rightarrow \#A \; B# \Rightarrow \dots
  \]

This cyclical behavior indicates the presence of an **infinite reduction sequence**, thereby violating strong normalization.

#### **No Advancement Towards Normal Form**

- **Absence of Annihilation:** The new `swap-AB` rule only rearranges symbols without contributing to the elimination of any symbols through annihilation.
- **Persistence of Reducible Pairs:** Each application of `swap-AB` or its inverse creates a scenario ripe for repetition, preventing the system from reaching a normal form.

---

### **Conclusion**

**Introducing the `swap-AB` rule (`#A B# => B# #A`) **_does_** make the AB system **non-strongly normalizing**.** This is because the new rule allows for the creation of infinite reduction sequences, preventing terms from reaching a normal form.

---

### **Implications for the AB System**

1. **Loss of Termination Guarantees:**
   
   - **Original System:** Every reduction sequence terminates, ensuring computational predictability.
   - **Modified System:** Potential for non-terminating computations undermines reliability.

2. **Undecidability of Normalization:**
   
   - **Original System:** Deciding normalization is straightforward due to termination.
   - **Modified System:** Infinite loops introduce ambiguity in determining normalization.

3. **Practical Considerations:**
   
   - **System Usage:** Systems relying on strong normalization for correctness (e.g., proof assistants) would be adversely affected.
   - **Algorithm Design:** Reduction strategies would need safeguards against non-termination, complicating implementations.

---

### **General Takeaways**

- **Rule Interactions Matter:** Adding new reduction rules can fundamentally alter system properties. It's crucial to analyze how new rules interact with existing ones.
  
- **Preventing Infinite Loops:** To maintain strong normalization, ensure that all reduction rules contribute towards simplifying the term, either by eliminating symbols or by progressing towards a canonical form without introducing cycles.

- **Formal Verification:** Employ formal methods to verify normalization properties when modifying term rewriting systems.

### **Understanding the AB System and Strong Normalization**

#### **1. Original AB System Recap**

- **Symbols:**
  - `A#`
  - `#A`
  - `B#`
  - `#B`

- **Original Reduction Rules:**
  1. **Commutation Rules:**
     - `comm-AB`: 
       \[
       A# \; \#B \Rightarrow \#B \; A#
       \]
     - `comm-BA`: 
       \[
       B# \; \#A \Rightarrow \#A \; B#
       \]
  2. **Annihilation Rules:**
     - `anni-AA`: 
       \[
       A# \; \#A \Rightarrow \text{(removed)}
       \]
     - `anni-BB`: 
       \[
       B# \; \#B \Rightarrow \text{(removed)}
       \]

- **Strong Normalization:**  
  The system is **strongly normalizing** because:
  - **Reduction Steps:** Each reduction either rearranges symbols or removes pairs, always progressing towards a simpler form.
  - **Termination Guarantee:** There's no possibility of infinite reduction sequences due to the finite number of symbols and the nature of the reduction rules.

#### **2. Modified AB System**

- **Modified Reduction Rule:**
  - **`anni-B` Modification:** 
    \[
    B# \; \#B \Rightarrow \#B \; A# \; A#
    \]
    - **Interpretation:** Instead of eliminating the `B# #B` pair, it replaces them with `#B A# A#`.

- **Other Reduction Rules:** Remain unchanged.

---

### **Analyzing the Impact of the Modified `anni-B` Rule**

#### **1. Potential for Infinite Reduction Sequences**

To determine if the modification introduces non-terminating (infinite) reduction paths, let's explore how reductions proceed under the modified rule.

##### **Example 1: Single Pair Reduction**

- **Initial Term:**
  ```
  B# #B
  ```
- **Apply Modified `anni-B`:**
  ```
  B# #B ⇒ #B A# A#
  ```
- **Resulting Term:**
  ```
  #B A# A#
  ```
- **Further Reductions:**
  - **Check for Reducible Pairs:**
    - `#B A#`: No direct reduction applicable.
    - `A# A#`: No reduction rule applies.
  - **Conclusion:** Reduction terminates.

##### **Example 2: Multiple Pairs Reduction**

- **Initial Term:**
  ```
  B# #B B# #B
  ```
- **First Reduction (`anni-B` on the first `B# #B`):**
  ```
  B# #B B# #B ⇒ #B A# A# B# #B
  ```
- **Second Reduction (`anni-B` on the remaining `B# #B`):**
  ```
  #B A# A# B# #B ⇒ #B A# A# #B A# A#
  ```
- **Resulting Term:**
  ```
  #B A# A# #B A# A#
  ```
- **Further Reductions:**
  - **Check for Reducible Pairs:**
    - `#B A#`: No reduction.
    - `A# A#`: No reduction.
    - `#B A#`: No reduction.
    - `A# A#`: No reduction.
  - **Conclusion:** Reduction terminates.

##### **Example 3: Complex Term with Nested Reductions**

- **Initial Term:**
  ```
  B# #B B# #B B# #B
  ```
- **Step-by-Step Reductions:**
  1. **First `anni-B`:**
     ```
     B# #B B# #B B# #B ⇒ #B A# A# B# #B B# #B
     ```
  2. **Second `anni-B`:**
     ```
     #B A# A# B# #B B# #B ⇒ #B A# A# #B A# A# B# #B
     ```
  3. **Third `anni-B`:**
     ```
     #B A# A# #B A# A# B# #B ⇒ #B A# A# #B A# A# #B A# A#
     ```
- **Resulting Term:**
  ```
  #B A# A# #B A# A# #B A# A#
  ```
- **Further Reductions:**
  - **Check for Reducible Pairs:**
    - All adjacent pairs (`#B A#`, `A# A#`, etc.) do not match any reduction rules.
  - **Conclusion:** Reduction terminates.

#### **2. Absence of Infinite Reduction Paths**

- **Reduction Mechanics:**
  - **`anni-B` Rule:**  
    - **Effect:** Replaces two `B#` symbols with one `#B` and two `A#` symbols.
    - **Symbol Count:** Reduces the number of `B#` symbols by one with each application.
    - **Terminating Condition:**  
      - **Finite `B#` Symbols:** Since each application of `anni-B` reduces the number of `B#` symbols, and there's a finite starting number, the number of possible `anni-B` reductions is bounded.
      - **No Introduction of New `B#` Symbols:** The modified rule does not reintroduce `B#` symbols, preventing a scenario where `B#` symbols are perpetually regenerated.

- **Annihilation of `A#` Symbols:**
  - **`anni-AA` Rule:**  
    - **Removes** pairs of `A# #A`.
    - **Creation:**  
      - **From Modified `anni-B`:**  
        - Each application introduces two `A#` symbols.
      - **Meeting `#A`:**  
        - If `A#` pairs with `#A`, they can be annihilated, further simplifying the term.
    - **Termination Contribution:**  
      - **Potential for Reduction:** Although `A#` symbols are introduced, they can eventually be removed if paired appropriately, ensuring that the system doesn’t indefinitely accumulate `A#` symbols without progress.

#### **3. Ensuring Termination**

- **Finite Reduction Steps:**
  - **`anni-B` Applications:** Limited by the initial number of `B#` symbols.
  - **`anni-AA` Applications:** Controlled by the availability of `#A` symbols to pair with `A#`.
  
- **No Infinite Loops:**
  - **No Cyclic Reductions:** The modified `anni-B` rule does not reintroduce pairs that could lead back to their original form.
  - **Progress Towards Simplicity:** Each reduction step either reduces the number of `B#` symbols or simplifies the configuration by removing `A#` pairs, moving the term closer to a normal form.

---

### **Conclusion**

**Modifying the `anni-B` rule to `B# #B => #B A# A#` does **_not_** make the AB system non-normalizing.** The system **remains strongly normalizing** because:

1. **Bounded Reduction Steps:** Each application of the modified `anni-B` rule reduces the number of `B#` symbols, ensuring that a finite number of such reductions can occur.

2. **Controlled Symbol Accumulation:** Though the modified rule introduces `A#` symbols, the existing `anni-AA` rule allows for their eventual annihilation, preventing indefinite growth of the term.

3. **Absence of Cyclic Paths:** There are no reduction rules that reintroduce conditions to perpetually apply `anni-B`, thereby avoiding infinite loops.

---

### **Visual Representation**

To further elucidate, let's visualize the reduction process with a more substantial term.

#### **Example Term:**
```
B# #B B# #B B# #B
```

#### **Reduction Steps:**

1. **First `anni-B`:**
   ```
   B# #B B# #B B# #B ⇒ #B A# A# B# #B B# #B
   ```
2. **Second `anni-B`:**
   ```
   #B A# A# B# #B B# #B ⇒ #B A# A# #B A# A# B# #B
   ```
3. **Third `anni-B`:**
   ```
   #B A# A# #B A# A# B# #B ⇒ #B A# A# #B A# A# #B A# A#
   ```
4. **Termination:**
   - **Resulting Term:** `#B A# A# #B A# A# #B A# A#`
   - **No Further Reductions Applicable:** All adjacent pairs do not match any reduction rules.

#### **Final Normal Form:**
```
#B A# A# #B A# A# #B A# A#
```

---

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Reduction Strategy Integrity:** The modified `anni-B` rule maintains the integrity of the reduction strategy by ensuring that reductions progress towards simpler or equivalent forms without creating cycles.

- **Symbol Elimination Assurance:** Even though `A#` symbols are introduced, the system's existing annihilation rules (`anni-AA`) effectively manage their removal when possible.

- **Strong Normalization Preservation:** The system's inherent structure, combined with the bounded nature of symbol reductions, guarantees that all reduction sequences terminate in a finite number of steps, preserving strong normalization.

---

### **Final Answer**

**No, modifying the `anni-B` rule to `B# #B => #B A# A#` does not make the AB system non-normalizing.** The system **remains strongly normalizing** because:

1. **Finite Reduction Steps:** Each application of the modified `anni-B` rule reduces the number of `B#` symbols, ensuring that only a finite number of such reductions can occur based on the initial term.

2. **Controlled Symbol Growth:** While the modified rule introduces `A#` symbols, these can be annihilated using the existing `anni-AA` rule when paired with `#A` symbols, preventing indefinite accumulation.

3. **No Cyclic Reductions:** The modification does not introduce any new rules or interactions that could create infinite reduction loops.

**Therefore, the AB system continues to guarantee that every term reduces to a normal form in a finite number of steps, maintaining its strong normalization property despite the modification.**

#Q7: Is there any term with length 4 that normalizes to a term with length 1?

Let's analyze **#Q7** to determine whether there exists an AB term of length 4 that normalizes to a term of length 1 within the AB system.

---

### **#Q7: Is there any term with length 4 that normalizes to a term with length 1?**

---

### **Understanding the AB System**

1. **AB Symbols:**
   - `A#`
   - `#A`
   - `B#`
   - `#B`

2. **Terms:**
   - Defined as lists of AB symbols.
   - For example: `A# #B B# #A` is a term of length 4.

3. **Reduction Rules:**
   - **Commutation Rules:**
     - `comm-AB`: 
       \[
       A# \; \#B \Rightarrow \#B \; A#
       \]
     - `comm-BA`: 
       \[
       B# \; \#A \Rightarrow \#A \; B#
       \]
   - **Annihilation Rules:**
     - `anni-AA`: 
       \[
       A# \; \#A \Rightarrow \text{(removed)}
       \]
     - `anni-BB`: 
       \[
       B# \; \#B \Rightarrow \text{(removed)}
       \]

4. **Normalization:**
   - A term is in **normal form** if no further reduction rules can be applied.

---

### **Analyzing Possible Length-4 Terms**

To determine if any length-4 term can normalize to a length-1 term, we'll explore the reduction possibilities systematically.

#### **General Approach:**
1. **Identify Reducible Pairs:**
   - Look for adjacent pairs that match any of the reduction rules.
2. **Apply Reduction Steps:**
   - Execute the applicable reduction rules.
3. **Track the Reduction Path:**
   - Observe the change in term length after each reduction.

#### **Key Observations:**
- **Annihilation Rules Remove Two Symbols:**
  - Each application of `anni-AA` or `anni-BB` removes **exactly two symbols**.
- **Commutation Rules Swap Two Symbols Without Removing Them:**
  - `comm-AB` and `comm-BA` only rearrange symbols, not altering the term's length.
- **Reducing to Length 1 Requires Removing Three Symbols:**
  - Starting with 4 symbols, reducing to 1 necessitates the removal of three symbols.
  - However, since reduction rules remove symbols in pairs (two at a time), it's impossible to remove an odd number of symbols directly.

#### **Example Reductions:**

1. **Term:** `A# #A B# #B`

   **Reduction Steps:**
   - Apply `anni-AA` to `A# #A`:
     \[
     A# \; \#A \Rightarrow \text{(removed)} \quad \Rightarrow \; B# \; #B
     \]
   - Apply `anni-BB` to `B# #B`:
     \[
     B# \; \#B \Rightarrow \text{(removed)} \quad \Rightarrow \; \text{(empty term)}
     \]
   - **Result:** Empty term (length 0)

2. **Term:** `B# #A A# #A`

   **Reduction Steps:**
   - Apply `comm-BA` to `B# #A`:
     \[
     B# \; \#A \Rightarrow \#A \; B#
     \]
     Resulting Term: `#A \; B# \; A# \; #A`
   - Apply `anni-AA` to `A# #A`:
     \[
     A# \; \#A \Rightarrow \text{(removed)} \quad \Rightarrow \; #A \; B#
     \]
   - **Result:** `#A \; B#` (length 2)

3. **Term:** `A# #B B# #A`

   **Reduction Steps:**
   - Apply `comm-AB` to `A# #B`:
     \[
     A# \; \#B \Rightarrow \#B \; A#
     \]
     Resulting Term: `#B \; A# \; B# \; #A`
   - Apply `comm-BA` to `B# #A`:
     \[
     B# \; \#A \Rightarrow \#A \; B#
     \]
     Resulting Term: `#B \; A# \; \#A \; B#`
   - Apply `anni-AA` to `A# \; #A`:
     \[
     A# \; \#A \Rightarrow \text{(removed)} \quad \Rightarrow \; #B \; B#
     \]
   - **Result:** `#B \; B#` (length 2)

4. **Term:** `A# A# #A #A`

   **Reduction Steps:**
   - No immediate annihilations.
   - No applicable commutation rules lead to annihilation.
   - **Result:** `A# A# #A #A` (length 4) remains unchanged.

#### **Attempting to Achieve Length 1:**

All reduction paths from length-4 terms either:
- **Reduce to length 0** (fully annihilated)
- **Reduce to length 2** (unable to proceed further due to unmatched pairs)
- **Remain at length 4** (if no applicable annihilations are possible)

**Crucial Point:** Reduction rules remove symbols in **pairs**. Therefore, from an **even-length** term, only even-length results are achievable through annihilations.

---

### **Conclusion**

**No, there is no term in the AB system with length 4 that normalizes to a term of length 1.**

**Rationale:**
- **Annihilation Mechanics:** Reduction rules eliminate symbols in pairs (two at a time).
- **Parity Preservation:** Starting with an even number of symbols (4), annihilations preserve evenness, leading to results of even lengths (2 or 0), but not to an odd length (1).
- **Commutation Rules:** These rules only rearrange symbols without affecting the term's length, preventing the creation of scenarios where an odd number of symbols can be eliminated.

**Therefore, it's impossible within the defined AB system to have a 4-symbol term reduce to a 1-symbol term.**

---

### **Visual Summary**

| **Initial Term (Length 4)** | **Reduction Steps**                                | **Final Term (Length)** |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `A# #A B# #B`               | `A# #A => ∅` → `B# #B => ∅`                        | ∅ (0)                   |
| `B# #A A# #A`               | `B# #A => #A B#` → `A# #A => ∅`                     | `#A B#` (2)             |
| `A# #B B# #A`               | `A# #B => #B A#` → `B# #A => #A B#` → `A# #A => ∅`  | `#B B#` (2)             |
| `A# A# #A #A`               | No applicable reductions                           | `A# A# #A #A` (4)        |

---

### **Further Considerations**

- **System Constraints:** The AB system's reduction rules inherently prevent reducing even-length terms to odd-length terms.
- **Normalization Paths:** While certain 4-symbol terms can fully annihilate to an empty term, none can precisely reduce to a single symbol.
- **Implications for AB System:** The parity-preserving nature ensures predictable normalization outcomes based on the initial term's length.

Certainly! Let's analyze **#Q8** to determine the maximum number of reduction steps a term with length 6 can require to reach its normal form in the **AB system**.

---

### **#Q8: What is the maximum number of steps that a term with length 6 can require to reach normal form?**

---

### **Recap of the AB System**

1. **Symbols:**
   - `A#`
   - `#A`
   - `B#`
   - `#B`

2. **Terms:**
   - Defined as lists of AB symbols.
   - Example: `A# #B B# #A A# #B` is a term of length 6.

3. **Reduction Rules:**
   - **Commutation Rules:**
     - `comm-AB`: 
       \[
       A# \; \#B \Rightarrow \#B \; A#
       \]
     - `comm-BA`: 
       \[
       B# \; \#A \Rightarrow \#A \; B#
       \]
   - **Annihilation Rules:**
     - `anni-AA`:

       \]

       B# \; \#B \Rightarrow \text{(removed)}
       \]

4. **Normalization:**
   - A term is in **normal form** if no further reduction rules can be applied.

---

### **Understanding the Reduction Steps**

To determine the maximum number of steps, we'll consider the following:

1. **Types of Reduction Steps:**
   - **Commutation Steps:** Swap two adjacent symbols without changing the term's length.
   - **Annihilation Steps:** Remove two adjacent symbols, reducing the term's length by 2.

2. **Goal:**
   - **Maximize the Number of Steps:** Arrange the term such that maximum commutations are required before performing annihilations.

3. **Constraints:**
   - **Removal in Pairs:** Annihilation rules remove symbols in pairs, maintaining parity (evenness or oddness) of the term's length.
   - **Strong Normalization:** The system ensures all reduction sequences terminate, preventing infinite loops.

---

### **Constructing a Worst-Case Scenario**

To achieve the maximum number of steps, we need a term that requires the most commutations before annihilations can occur. Here's a step-by-step construction:

#### **Example Term:**
\[
\text{Term} = A# \; B# \; A# \; #B \; A# \; #B
\]
- **Length:** 6

#### **Reduction Steps:**

1. **Step 1: Apply `comm-AB` to the first `A# \; #B`**
   \[
   A# \; #B \; A# \; #B \; A# \; #B \Rightarrow \#B \; A# \; A# \; #B \; A# \; #B
   \]
   - **Term After Step 1:**
     \[
     \#B \; A# \; A# \; #B \; A# \; #B
     \]

2. **Step 2: Apply `anni-BB` to `\#B \; A#`**
   - **No direct annihilation possible.**
   - **Instead, look for next possible reductions.**

3. **Step 2: Apply `comm-BA` to `B# \; A#`**
   \[
   \#B \; A# \; A# \; #B \; A# \; #B \Rightarrow \#B \; A# \; A# \; #B \; A# \; #B
   \]
   - **No change; indicates non-productive step.**

4. **Alternative Approach:**
   - Instead of applying `comm-BA`, prioritize annihilations where possible.

5. **Step 2 (Revised): Apply `anni-AA` to the middle `A# \; #B`**
   - **Not directly applicable.**
   - **Rearrange further:**

6. **Step 2: Apply `comm-BA` to `B# \; A#` to move towards annihilation**
   \[
   \#B \; A# \; A# \; #B \; A# \; #B \Rightarrow \#B \; #B \; A# \; A# \; A# \; #B
   \]
   - **Term After Step 2:**
     \[
     \#B \; #B \; A# \; A# \; A# \; #B
     \]

7. **Step 3: Apply `anni-BB` to `\#B \; #B`**
   \[
   \#B \; #B \; A# \; A# \; A# \; #B \Rightarrow A# \; A# \; A# \; #B
   \]
   - **Term After Step 3:**
     \[
     A# \; A# \; A# \; #B
     \]

8. **Step 4: Apply `comm-AB` to `A# \; #B`**
   \[
   A# \; A# \; A# \; #B \Rightarrow A# \; A# \; #B \; A#
   \]
   - **Term After Step 4:**
     \[
     A# \; A# \; #B \; A#
     \]

9. **Step 5: Apply `anni-AA` to `A# \; #A` (Needs rearrangement)**
   - **First, apply `comm-BA` if necessary.**

10. **Step 5: Apply `comm-AB` to `A# \; #B`**
    \[
    A# \; A# \; #B \; A# \Rightarrow A# \; A# \; A# \; #B
    \]
    - **No progress; indicates optimization needed.**

**Observation:**
- The reduction sequence appears to be cycling without progress, indicating a potential flaw in the initial term construction.

---

### **Optimized Reduction Path**

To avoid cycles and maximize the number of steps, let's revise the term:

#### **Optimized Term:**
\[
\text{Term} = A# \; B# \; #A \; B# \; A# \; #B
\]
- **Length:** 6

#### **Reduction Steps:**

1. **Step 1: Apply `comm-BA` to `B# \; #A`**
   \[
   A# \; B# \; #A \; B# \; A# \; #B \Rightarrow A# \; #A \; B# \; B# \; A# \; #B
   \]
   - **Term After Step 1:**
     \[
     A# \; #A \; B# \; B# \; A# \; #B
     \]

2. **Step 2: Apply `anni-AA` to `A# \; #A`**
   \[
   A# \; #A \; B# \; B# \; A# \; #B \Rightarrow B# \; B# \; A# \; #B
   \]
   - **Term After Step 2:**
     \[
     B# \; B# \; A# \; #B
     \]

3. **Step 3: Apply `anni-BB` to `B# \; B#`**
   \[
   B# \; B# \; A# \; #B \Rightarrow A# \; #B
   \]
   - **Term After Step 3:**
     \[
     A# \; #B
     \]

4. **Step 4: Apply `comm-AB` to `A# \; #B`**
   \[
   A# \; #B \Rightarrow \#B \; A#
   \]
   - **Term After Step 4:**
     \[
     \#B \; A#
     \]

5. **Step 5: No further reductions applicable.**
   - **Normal Form Achieved:**
     \[
     \#B \; A#
     \]
   - **Length:** 2

**Total Reduction Steps:** 5

---

### **Constructing a Longer Reduction Path**

To maximize the number of steps, consider arranging the term such that multiple commutations are required before each annihilation. Here's an example:

#### **Complex Term Example:**
\[
\text{Term} = A# \; B# \; A# \; #B \; #A \; B#
\]
- **Length:** 6

#### **Reduction Steps:**

1. **Step 1: Apply `comm-AB` to `A# \; #B`**
   \[
   A# \; B# \; A# \; #B \; #A \; B# \Rightarrow A# \; B# \; A# \; #B \; #A \; B#
   \]
   - **No change; indicates step is unproductive.**

2. **Alternate Approach:**
   - Apply `comm-BA` to `B# \; #A` first.

3. **Step 1: Apply `comm-BA` to `B# \; #A`**
   \[
   A# \; B# \; A# \; #B \; #A \; B# \Rightarrow A# \; #A \; A# \; #B \; B# \; B#
   \]
   - **Term After Step 1:**
     \[
     A# \; #A \; A# \; #B \; B# \; B#
     \]

4. **Step 2: Apply `anni-AA` to `A# \; #A`**
   \[
   A# \; #A \; A# \; #B \; B# \; B# \Rightarrow A# \; #B \; B# \; B#
   \]
   - **Term After Step 2:**
     \[
     A# \; #B \; B# \; B#
     \]

5. **Step 3: Apply `comm-AB` to `A# \; #B`**
   \[
   A# \; #B \; B# \; B# \Rightarrow \#B \; A# \; B# \; B#
   \]
   - **Term After Step 3:**
     \[
     \#B \; A# \; B# \; B#
     \]

6. **Step 4: Apply `anni-BB` to `B# \; B#`**
   \[
   \#B \; A# \; B# \; B# \Rightarrow \#B \; A# 
   \]
   - **Term After Step 4:**
     \[
     \#B \; A#
     \]

7. **Step 5: No further reductions applicable.**
   - **Normal Form Achieved:**
     \[
     \#B \; A#
     \]
   - **Length:** 2

**Total Reduction Steps:** 4

---

### **Final Analysis**

After constructing and analyzing various reduction paths for terms of length 6, the following observations emerge:

1. **Reduction Steps Involve Both Commutations and Annihilations:**
   - **Commutations:** Rearrange symbols, potentially increasing the number of steps needed before annihilations can occur.
   - **Annihilations:** Reduce the term's length by removing pairs of symbols.

2. **Maximum Reduction Steps:**
   - The constructed examples show that a term of length 6 can require up to **5 reduction steps** to reach its normal form.

3. **Potential for More Steps:**
   - While the examples provided showcase up to 5 steps, it's theoretically possible to design terms that might require additional commutations before annihilations, but practical constraints limit the total number of steps.

4. **Upper Bound Consideration:**
   - Given the system's rules and the need to eliminate symbols in pairs, the **upper bound** for reduction steps in this system scales linearly with the term's length. For a term of length 6, the **maximum number of steps** required is **5**.

---

### **Conclusion**

**The maximum number of reduction steps that a term with length 6 can require to reach its normal form in the AB system is 5 steps.**

**Summary:**
- **Terms of Length 6:** Can require up to **5 reduction steps**.
- **Reduction Sequence:** Involves strategic commutations followed by annihilations to minimize term length.
- **Strong Normalization Assurance:** Ensures that all reduction sequences terminate, preventing infinite loops.

### **Recap of the AB System**

1. **AB Symbols:**
   - `A#`
   - `#A`
   - `B#`
   - `#B`

2. **Terms:**
   - Defined as lists (sequences) of AB symbols.
   - Example: `A# #B B# #A A# #B` is a term of length 6.

3. **Reduction Rules:**
   - **Commutation Rules:**
     - `comm-AB`: 
       \[
       A# \; \#B \Rightarrow \#B \; A#
       \]
     - `comm-BA`: 
       \[
       B# \; \#A \Rightarrow \#A \; B#
       \]

       \]

       \[
       B# \; \#B \Rightarrow \text{(removed)}
       \]

4. **Normalization:**
   - A term is in **normal form** if **no further reduction rules** can be applied.

---

### **Objective**

Determine the **maximum number of reduction steps** required to normalize a term of length \( 2N \).

---

### **Understanding Reduction Steps**

There are two types of reduction steps:

1. **Commutation Steps:**
   - Swap two adjacent symbols if they match a commutation rule.
   - **Effect:** Does **not** change the term's length.

2. **Annihilation Steps:**
   - Remove two adjacent symbols if they match an annihilation rule.
   - **Effect:** **Reduces** the term's length by **2**.

---

### **Strategy for Maximizing Reduction Steps**

To achieve the **maximum number of steps**, we need to:

1. **Maximize Commutation Steps:**
   - Arrange symbols such that **multiple commutations** are required before any annihilation can occur.

2. **Minimize Annihilation Steps:**
   - Delay annihilations as much as possible by requiring commutations to prepare pairs for annihilation.

3. **Maintain Progress Towards Normal Form:**
   - Ensure that each reduction step contributes towards eventual annihilation, preventing infinite loops.

---

### **Constructing a Term Requiring Maximum Steps**

**Hypothesis:** For a term of length \( 2N \), the **maximum number of reduction steps** required to reach normal form is **\( 2N - 1 \)**.

**Rationale:**
- **Each Annihilation Requires a Prior Commutation:**
  - To annihilate \( N \) pairs, you may need \( N - 1 \) commutation steps to arrange the symbols appropriately.
- **Total Steps:**
  - \( N \) annihilation steps.
  - \( N - 1 \) commutation steps.
  - **Total:** \( 2N - 1 \) steps.

---

### **Formalizing the Maximum Steps Calculation**

1. **Initial Term Length:** \( 2N \) symbols.

2. **Reduction Steps Needed:**
   - **Commutations:** \( N - 1 \) steps.
     - **Purpose:** Arrange symbols to form pairs eligible for annihilation.
   - **Annihilations:** \( N \) steps.
     - **Purpose:** Remove each pair of symbols.

3. **Total Maximum Steps:**
   \[
   \text{Total Steps} = (N - 1) + N = 2N - 1
   \]

---

### **General Proof of \( 2N - 1 \) Steps**

1. **Base Case (\( N = 1 \)):**
   - **Term:** `A# #A`.
   - **Steps:** 1 annihilation.
   - **Formula Check:** \( 2(1) - 1 = 1 \). **Valid**.

2. **Inductive Step:**
   - **Assume:** For a term with length \( 2K \), maximum steps = \( 2K - 1 \).
   - **For \( K + 1 \):** 
     - Insert two additional symbols requiring one extra annihilation and up to one extra commutation.
     - **Total Steps:** \( (2K - 1) + 2 - 1 = 2(K + 1) - 1 \).

3. **Conclusion:**
   - By induction, the formula holds for all \( N \geq 1 \).

### **Final Answer**

**For any term of length \( 2N \) in the AB system, the maximum number of reduction steps required to reach normal form is \( 2N - 1 \) steps.**

RESULT:

- Q0: What's the normal form of `#A A# #B A# A# B# B# #A #B B# #A B# #B`?
- A0: #A #B A# B# B#, by reduction.
- J0: User reduced the term step-by-step to #A #B B#, which is incorrect compared to the reference answer
- S0: 0

- Q1: Is the AB system strongly normalizing?
- A1: Yes, because annis decrease the length, and comms can't produce infinite loops.
- J1: User correctly states the AB system is strongly normalizing, explaining that annihilations decrease term length and commutations can't produce infinite loops
- S1: 1

- Q2: In a normalized term starting with `#A B#`, which symbols can occur afterwards?
- A2: A# and B#, because other symbols would trigger reductions.
- J2: The user did not provide a complete answer to the question
- S2: 0

- Q3: In a normalized term starting with `A#`, which symbols can NOT occur afterwards?
- A3: #B and #A, because they would trigger reductions.
- J3: The user did not provide a complete answer to the question
- S3: 0

- Q4: This system is strongly normalizing. Would allowing only inputs with a single letter type make it non-normalizing?
- A4: No, the system would remain strongly normalizing, because it is a subset of a normalizing system.
- J4: The user did not provide a complete answer to the question
- S4: 0

- Q5: This system is strongly normalizing. Would introducing the `swap-AB` rule: `#A B# => B# #A` make it non-normalizing?
- A5: Yes, the system would become non-normalizing, since comms and swap can mutually result in infinite loops.
- J5: User correctly states that introducing swap-AB makes the system non-normalizing, demonstrating an infinite reduction sequence using swap-AB and comm-BA
- S5: 1

- Q6: This system is strongly normalizing. Would modifying the `anni-B` rule to `B# #B => #B A# A#` make it non-normalizing?
- A6: No, the system would remain strongly normalizing, despite the rule increasing in length. That's because we'll eventually run out of B# symbols to trigger `anni-B` rules.
- J6: The user did not provide a complete answer to the question
- S6: 0

- Q7: Is there any term with length 4 that normalizes to a term with length 1?
