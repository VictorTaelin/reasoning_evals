Let an AB symbol be one of 4 possible variants:

  data AB : Set where
    A# : AB
    #A : AB
    B# : AB
    #B : AB

Let an AB Term be a list of AB symbols:

  Term : Set = List AB

An AB system computes via the following step reduction relation:

  data _=>_ : List AB → List AB → Set where
    comm-AB : ∀ xs → (A# ∷ #B ∷ xs) => (#B ∷ A# ∷ xs)
    comm-BA : ∀ xs → (B# ∷ #A ∷ xs) => (#A ∷ B# ∷ xs)
    anni-AA : ∀ xs → (A# ∷ #A ∷ xs) => xs
    anni-BB : ∀ xs → (B# ∷ #B ∷ xs) => xs

An AB term is in normal form if it can't be reduced further.

For example, the normal form of the term below can be computed in 3 steps:

  B# A# #B #A B#
  -------------- comm-AB
  B# #B A# #А B#
  -------------- anni-BB
  A# #А B#
  -------- anni-AA
  B#

Note that a pair only interacts when the '#' is internal.
For example, 'A# #A' interacts, but '#A A#' does not.

Your goal is to answer logical questions about this system. Can we start?

Certainly! I'd be happy to help answer logical questions about the AB system you've described. Please feel free to ask your questions.

#Q0: What's the normal form of `#A A# #B A# A# B# B# #A #B B# #A B# #B`?

To find the normal form of the AB term:
```
#A A# #B A# A# B# B# #A #B B# #A B# #B
```
we will systematically apply the reduction rules you've provided until no further reductions are possible. Here are the steps:

**Initial Term**:
```
1: #A
2: A#
3: #B
4: A#
5: A#
6: B#
7: B#
8: #A
9: #B

13: #B
```

**Step 1**: Apply `comm-AB` to positions 2 and 3 (A# followed by #B).
- Before: `... A# #B ...`
- After:  Swap to `... #B A# ...`

**Result**:
```
1: #A
2: #B
3: A#
4: A#
5: A#
6: B#
7: B#
8: #A
9: #B
10: B#
11: #A
12: B#
13: #B
```

**Step 2**: Apply `comm-BA` to positions 7 and 8 (B# followed by #A).
- Before: `... B# #A ...`
- After:  Swap to `... #A B# ...`

**Result**:
```
1: #A
2: #B
3: A#
4: A#
5: A#
6: B#
7: #A
8: B#
9: #B
10: B#
11: #A
12: B#
13: #B
```

**Step 3**: Apply `comm-BA` again to positions 6 and 7.
- Before: `... B# #A ...`
- After:  Swap to `... #A B# ...`

**Result**:
```
1: #A
2: #B
3: A#
4: A#
5: A#
6: #A
7: B#
8: B#
9: #B
10: B#
11: #A
12: B#
13: #B
```

**Step 4**: Apply `anni-AA` to positions 5 and 6 (A# followed by #A).
- Remove `A# #A`

**Result**:
```
1: #A
2: #B
3: A#
4: A#
5: B#
6: B#
7: #B
8: B#
9: #A
10: B#
11: #B
```

**Step 5**: Apply `anni-BB` to positions 6 and 7 (B# followed by #B).
- Remove `B# #B`

**Result**:
```
1: #A
2: #B
3: A#
4: A#
5: B#
6: B#
7: #A
8: B#
9: #B
```

**Step 6**: Apply `comm-BA` to positions 6 and 7.
- Before: `... B# #A ...`
- After: Swap to `... #A B# ...`

**Result**:
```
1: #A
2: #B
3: A#
4: A#
5: B#
6: #A
7: B#
8: B#
9: #B
```

**Step 7**: Apply `anni-AA` to positions 4 and 5.
- Remove `A# #A`

**Result**:
```
1: #A
2: #B
3: A#
4: B#
5: B#
6: B#
7: #B
```

**Step 8**: Apply `anni-BB` to positions 6 and 7.
- Remove `B# #B`

**Result**:
```
1: #A
2: #B
3: A#
4: B#
5: B#
```

**Final Term** (Normal Form):
```
#A #B A# B# B#
```

**Explanation**:
- No further reductions can be applied because none of the pairs in the final term match the left-hand side of the reduction rules.
- Each step reduces the term by either swapping adjacent symbols according to the commutation rules or eliminating pairs of symbols according to the annihilation rules.
- The final term is in normal form because it cannot be reduced further based on the given rules.

**Answer**:
```
#A #B A# B# B#
```

#Q1: Is the AB system strongly normalizing?

**Answer to Q1:**

Yes, the AB system is **strongly normalizing**. This means that every sequence of reductions in the system must eventually terminate at a normal form, and there are no infinite reduction sequences possible.

---

**Explanation:**

To determine if the AB system is strongly normalizing, we need to show that every possible reduction sequence starting from any term will eventually reach a normal form (a term that cannot be reduced further) and that there are no infinite reduction paths.

Let's analyze the properties of the AB system:

1. **Finite Term Length:**
   - The terms are finite lists of symbols from the set `{A#, #A, B#, #B}`.
   - Since the initial term length is finite and reductions do not increase the length of the term, we cannot have an infinite term length.

2. **Reduction Rules:**
   - **Annihilation Rules (Length-Decreasing):**
     - `anni-AA`: `(A# ∷ #A ∷ xs) => xs` removes two symbols.
     - `anni-BB`: `(B# ∷ #B ∷ xs) => xs` removes two symbols.
     - These rules strictly decrease the length of the term by 2.
   - **Commutation Rules (Length-Preserving):**
     - `comm-AB`: `(A# ∷ #B ∷ xs) => (#B ∷ A# ∷ xs)`.
     - `comm-BA`: `(B# ∷ #A ∷ xs) => (#A ∷ B# ∷ xs)`.
     - These rules rearrange symbols but do not change the term's length.

3. **No Infinite Rewriting Cycles:**
   - The commutation rules can only be applied when specific adjacent patterns (`A# #B` or `B# #A`) occur.
   - After rearranging symbols using commutation, either new annihilation opportunities arise, or the term gradually becomes unable to apply further reductions.
   - There is no way to construct an infinite sequence of commutations without eventually reaching a point where no further rules apply.

4. **Well-Founded Measure:**
   - We can define a measure based on the term's length.
   - **Measure Function \( f \):** Assign to each term the number of symbols it contains.
     - **Annihilation Steps:** Decrease \( f \) by 2 (since two symbols are removed).
     - **Commutation Steps:** Keep \( f \) the same.
   - Since \( f \) decreases with annihilation and cannot increase, and the term length is finite, we cannot have an infinite descending sequence of natural numbers. Therefore, all reduction sequences must terminate.

---

**Conclusion:**

- **Every reduction sequence is finite:** Because the term length decreases strictly with annihilation and cannot increase, and there is no way to rearrange symbols indefinitely.
- **No infinite reductions:** The absence of infinite rewriting cycles ensures that no term can be reduced indefinitely.
- **Strong normalization holds:** Every term in the AB system reduces to a normal form in a finite number of steps.

---

**Therefore**, the AB system is strongly normalizing.

#Q2: In a normalized term starting with `#A B#`, which symbols can occur afterwards?

**Answer to Q2:**

In a normalized term starting with `#A B#`, **only the symbols `A#` and `B#` can occur afterwards**. This means that the term consists of `#A B#` followed by a (possibly empty) sequence of `A#` and `B#` symbols. No `#A` or `#B` symbols can occur after `#A B#` in a normalized term.

---

**Explanation:**

To determine which symbols can occur after `#A B#` in a normalized term, we need to examine the reduction rules of the AB system and understand how they restrict the placement of symbols to prevent further reductions.

**AB System Reduction Rules:**

1. **Commutation Rules (Swapping adjacent symbols):**
   - `comm-AB`: `A# ∷ #B ∷ xs => #B ∷ A# ∷ xs`
   - `comm-BA`: `B# ∷ #A ∷ xs => #A ∷ B# ∷ xs`

2. **Annihilation Rules (Removing pairs of symbols):**
   - `anni-AA`: `A# ∷ #A ∷ xs => xs`
   - `anni-BB`: `B# ∷ #B ∷ xs => xs`

3. **Note:** A pair only **interacts** when the `#` is internal. For example, `A# #A` interacts (can be reduced), but `#A A#` does not.

---

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

**Step 1: Identify Potential Reductions After `#A B#`**

- **Given Term Prefix:** `#A B#`
- **We Need to Determine:** Which symbols (`s1`, `s2`, ...) can follow `B#` without enabling any reduction rules.

**Step 2: Determine Valid Symbols After `B#`**

- **Possible Symbols:** `A#`, `#A`, `B#`, `#B`

We need to consider each possible symbol `s1` that can follow `B#` and see if it creates a reducible pair.

**a) If `s1 = A#`:**

- **Pair:** `B# A#`
- **Reduction Check:** No reduction applies to `B# A#` because none of the rules match this pattern.
- **Conclusion:** `A#` is acceptable after `B#`.

**b) If `s1 = B#`:**

- **Pair:** `B# B#`
- **Reduction Check:** No reduction applies to `B# B#` because the annihilation rule `anni-BB` only applies to `B# #B`.
- **Conclusion:** `B#` is acceptable after `B#`.

**c) If `s1 = #A`:**

- **Pair:** `B# #A`
- **Reduction Check:** Matches `comm-BA` rule: `B# #A => #A B#` (reducible).
- **Conclusion:** `#A` is **not** acceptable after `B#` in a normalized term.

**d) If `s1 = #B`:**

- **Pair:** `B# #B`
- **Reduction Check:** Matches `anni-BB` rule: `B# #B => xs` (reducible).
- **Conclusion:** `#B` is **not** acceptable after `B#` in a normalized term.

**Step 3: Determine Valid Symbols After `A#`**

Assuming we have `A#` after `B#`, we now consider which symbols can follow `A#`.

- **Possible Symbols:** `A#`, `#A`, `B#`, `#B`

**a) If `s2 = A#`:**

- **Pair:** `A# A#`
- **Reduction Check:** No reduction applies.
- **Conclusion:** `A#` is acceptable after `A#`.

**b) If `s2 = B#`:**

- **Pair:** `A# B#`
- **Reduction Check:** No reduction applies.
- **Conclusion:** `B#` is acceptable after `A#`.

**c) If `s2 = #A`:**

- **Pair:** `A# #A`
- **Reduction Check:** Matches `anni-AA` rule: `A# #A => xs` (reducible).
- **Conclusion:** `#A` is **not** acceptable after `A#` in a normalized term.

**d) If `s2 = #B`:**

- **Pair:** `A# #B`
- **Reduction Check:** Matches `comm-AB` rule: `A# #B => #B A#` (reducible).
- **Conclusion:** `#B` is **not** acceptable after `A#`.

**Step 4: Summary of Allowed Symbols**

- **Allowed Symbols After `B#` or `A#`:** Only `A#` and `B#` (the symbols with `#` on the right side).
- **Disallowed Symbols After `B#` or `A#`:** `#A` and `#B` (the symbols with `#` on the left side), because they lead to reductions.

**Step 5: Constructing the Normalized Term**

- **Initial Term:** `#A B#`
- **Continuation:** A sequence of zero or more symbols from `{A#, B#}`.

So the normalized term has the form:

```
#A B# [A# or B#]* (zero or more times)
```

---

**Example of a Normalized Term Starting with `#A B#`:**

- `#A B# A# B# A# B#`
- **Explanation:** Only `A#` and `B#` follow `#A B#`. No reductions can be applied because none of the pairs match the left-hand side of any reduction rule.

**Why `#A` and `#B` Cannot Occur After `#A B#` in a Normalized Term:**

- **If `#A` Occurs:**
  - It must follow `A#` or `B#`, but:
    - `A# #A`: Reducible via `anni-AA`.
    - `B# #A`: Reducible via `comm-BA`.
- **If `#B` Occurs:**
  - It must follow `A#` or `B#`, but:
    - `A# #B`: Reducible via `comm-AB`.
    - `B# #B`: Reducible via `anni-BB`.

Therefore, including `#A` or `#B` after `#A B#` would make the term reducible, contradicting the assumption that it is normalized.

---

**Conclusion:**

In a normalized term starting with `#A B#`, only the symbols `A#` and `B#` can occur afterwards. This restriction ensures that no further reductions can be applied, and the term remains in its normal form.

#Q3: In a normalized term starting with `A#`, which symbols can NOT occur afterwards?

**Answer to Q3:**

In a normalized term starting with `A#`, the symbols that **cannot occur afterwards** are **`#A` and `#B`**. This means that after the initial `A#` in such a term, only the symbols `A#` and `B#` can appear. Including `#A` or `#B` anywhere after `A#` would create opportunities for reductions, preventing the term from being in normal form.

---

**Explanation:**

To determine which symbols cannot occur after `A#` in a normalized term, we need to analyze how the AB system's reduction rules interact with sequences following `A#`. A normalized term is one where no further reductions can be applied based on the given rules. We'll examine each possible symbol that could follow `A#` and see whether it would lead to a reducible pattern.

**AB System Reduction Rules Recap:**

1. **Commutation Rules:**
   - `comm-AB`: `A# ∷ #B ∷ xs => #B ∷ A# ∷ xs`
   - `comm-BA`: `B# ∷ #A ∷ xs => #A ∷ B# ∷ xs`

2. **Annihilation Rules:**
   - `anni-AA`: `A# ∷ #A ∷ xs => xs`
   - `anni-BB`: `B# ∷ #B ∷ xs => xs`

**Key Point:** A pair only interacts when the `#` is internal: `A# #A` interacts (can be reduced), but `#A A#` does not.

---

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

**Possible Symbols After `A#`:** The symbols from the set `{A#, #A, B#, #B}`.

We'll examine each symbol to see if it can safely occur after `A#` in a normalized term.

---

**1. Symbol `A#` After `A#`:**

- **Pair Considered:** `A# A#`

- **Reduction Check:** No reduction rule matches `A# A#`.

- **Conclusion:** `A#` can occur after `A#` in a normalized term.

---

**2. Symbol `B#` After `A#`:**

- **Pair Considered:** `A# B#`

- **Reduction Check:** No reduction rule matches `A# B#`.

- **Conclusion:** `B#` can occur after `A#` in a normalized term.

---

**3. Symbol `#A` After `A#`:**

- **Pair Considered:** `A# #A`

- **Reduction Check:** Matches the **annihilation rule** `anni-AA`.

  - **Reduction:** `A# #A => xs` (the pair is removed).

- **Conclusion:** `#A` **cannot** occur after `A#` in a normalized term, as it would lead to a reduction.

---

**4. Symbol `#B` After `A#`:**

- **Pair Considered:** `A# #B`

- **Reduction Check:** Matches the **commutation rule** `comm-AB`.

  - **Reduction:** `A# #B => #B A#`

  - After applying `comm-AB`, new reduction opportunities might arise.

- **Conclusion:** `#B` **cannot** occur after `A#` in a normalized term because it leads to a reducible situation.

---

**Further Considerations:**

Including `#A` or `#B` anywhere after `A#` can create reducible patterns due to the interaction rules:

- **Indirect Reductions:**

  - Even if `#A` or `#B` do not immediately follow `A#`, their presence later in the term can enable reductions when adjacent to `A#` or `B#`.

- **Examples:**

  - If `B#` occurs after `A#` and is followed by `#A`:

    - The pair `B# #A` matches `comm-BA`: `B# #A => #A B#` (reducible).

  - This chain of reductions contradicts the term being in normal form.

---

**Conclusion:**

- **Symbols That Cannot Occur After `A#`:** `#A` and `#B`

  - Including these symbols leads to reductions via the annihilation or commutation rules.

- **Symbols That Can Occur After `A#`:** `A#` and `B#`

  - These symbols do not create reducible pairs when following `A#`.

**Therefore**, in a normalized term starting with `A#`, the symbols `#A` and `#B` cannot occur afterwards.

---

**Summary:**

- **Cannot Occur After `A#`:** `#A`, `#B`

- **Can Occur After `A#`:** `A#`, `B#`

This restriction ensures that the term remains in normal form, with no further reductions possible.

#Q4: This system is strongly normalizing. Would allowing only inputs with a single letter type make it non-normalizing?

**Answer to Q4:**

No, allowing only inputs with a single letter type **does not** make the AB system non-normalizing. The system remains **strongly normalizing** even when restricted to inputs containing symbols of only one letter type (either only `A` symbols or only `B` symbols).

---

**Explanation:**

To determine whether the AB system becomes non-normalizing when restricted to a single letter type, we need to analyze the behavior of the system under this constraint and examine whether infinite reduction sequences can occur.

### 1. **Understanding the Restriction**

#### **Original Symbol Set:**

The original AB system has the following symbols:

- **Symbols involving `A`:** `A#`, `#A`
- **Symbols involving `B`:** `B#`, `#B`

#### **Reduction Rules:**

- **Annihilation Rules:**
  - `anni-AA`: `A# ∷ #A ∷ xs => xs`
  - `anni-BB`: `B# ∷ #B ∷ xs => xs`
- **Commutation Rules:**
  - `comm-AB`: `A# ∷ #B ∷ xs => #B ∷ A# ∷ xs`
  - `comm-BA`: `B# ∷ #A ∷ xs => #A ∷ B# ∷ xs`

#### **Restriction to a Single Letter Type:**

- **Symbols:** Only `A#` and `#A` **or** only `B#` and `#B`.
- **Reduction Rules:** Only the annihilation rule applicable to the chosen letter type:
  - For `A` only: `anni-AA`
  - For `B` only: `anni-BB`

**Note:** The commutation rules involve both `A` and `B`, so they are **not** applicable in a single-letter system.

### 2. **Analyzing the Single-Letter System**

#### **Reduction Behavior:**

- **Annihilation Rule (Length-Decreasing):**
  - `anni-AA`: Removes the pair `A# #A`.
  - **Effect:** Reduces the term length by 2.
- **No Commutation Rules Apply:**
  - Since we have only one letter type, there's no possibility of swapping adjacent symbols, as commutation rules require both `A` and `B`.
- **No Length-Increasing Rules:**
  - All reductions decrease the term length or leave it unchanged.
- **No New Redexes Created:**
  - Applying the annihilation rule does not create new opportunities for reductions elsewhere in the term.

#### **Example:**

Consider an initial term with `A` symbols:

```
Term: [A#, #A, A#, #A, A#]
```

Reduction Steps:

1. **First Annihilation:**
   - Apply `anni-AA` to the first `A# #A` pair.
   - Term becomes: `[A#, #A, A#]`
2. **Second Annihilation:**
   - Apply `anni-AA` to the next `A# #A` pair.
   - Term becomes: `[A#]`
3. **No Further Reductions:**
   - Only one symbol remains; no reduction applies.

**Result:** The term reduces to its normal form in a finite number of steps.

### 3. **Strong Normalization Holds**

#### **Finite Term Length:**

- All terms are finite sequences of symbols.
- With only annihilation rules, the term length can only decrease.

#### **Well-Founded Measure:**

- **Measure Function \( f \):** The number of symbol pairs (`A#`, `#A`) in the term.
- **Annihilation Reductions Decrease \( f \):**
  - Each application of `anni-AA` reduces \( f \) by 1.
- Since \( f \) is a natural number and decreases with each reduction, we cannot have an infinite descending sequence.

#### **No Infinite Reduction Sequences:**

- There are no rules that can be applied indefinitely.
- The process of applying annihilation rules must terminate when no more `A# #A` pairs are present.

### 4. **Comparison with the Original System**

- **Original System (Both Letters):**
  - Strongly normalizing due to decreasing term lengths and lack of infinite commutation sequences.
- **Single-Letter System:**
  - Even more restricted than the original.
  - Lacks commutation rules that could potentially lead to longer reduction sequences.
  - The only active rule strictly reduces term length.

### 5. **Conclusion**

- **Restricting the system to one letter type does not introduce non-terminating behavior.**
- **The system remains strongly normalizing** because:
  - Reduction sequences are finite.
  - Term lengths decrease with each reduction.
  - No new redexes (reducible expressions) are created that can cause infinite reductions.

---

**Therefore**, allowing only inputs with a single letter type **does not** make the AB system non-normalizing. The system continues to be strongly normalizing under this restriction.

---

### **Additional Insight**

- **Why Might One Think It Could Become Non-Normalizing?**

  - **Commutation Loops:** In the full system, one might worry that commutation rules could create loops. However, these rules require both `A` and `B` symbols.
  - **Single-Letter Limitations:** With only one letter type, commutation rules are not applicable, eliminating any concern about infinite commutation sequences.

- **Implications:**

  - **Simplified Analysis:** The absence of commutation rules in the single-letter system simplifies the analysis of normalization.
  - **Guaranteed Termination:** Since only length-decreasing rules apply, termination is guaranteed after a finite number of steps.

---

**Key Takeaway:**

- **Strong normalization is preserved** even when the AB system is restricted to inputs with a single letter type.
- The behavior of the system under this restriction confirms that it remains well-behaved and terminates after a finite number of reductions.

#Q5: This system is strongly normalizing. Would introducing the `swap-AB` rule: `#A B# => B# #A` make it non-normalizing?

**Answer to Q5:**

Yes, introducing the `swap-AB` rule `#A ∷ B# ⇒ B# ∷ #A` would make the AB system **non-normalizing**. Adding this rule creates the possibility of infinite reduction sequences, leading to non-termination and violating strong normalization.

---

**Explanation:**

To determine whether the AB system remains strongly normalizing after introducing the `swap-AB` rule, we need to analyze how this new rule interacts with the existing rules and whether it allows for infinite reduction sequences.

### **1. Existing AB System Rules**

#### **Annihilation Rules (Length-Decreasing):**

1. `anni-AA`: `A# ∷ #A ∷ xs ⇒ xs`
2. `anni-BB`: `B# ∷ #B ∷ xs ⇒ xs`

#### **Commutation Rules (Length-Preserving):**

1. `comm-AB`: `A# ∷ #B ∷ xs ⇒ #B ∷ A# ∷ xs`
2. `comm-BA`: `B# ∷ #A ∷ xs ⇒ #A ∷ B# ∷ xs`

#### **Interaction Note:**

- **Pairs interact only when the `#` is internal.**
  - **Interacting Pairs:** `A# #A`, `B# #B`, `A# #B`, `B# #A`
  - **Non-Interacting Pairs:** `#A A#`, `#B B#`, `#A B#`, `#B A#`

### **2. New Rule Introduced**

#### **Swap Rule (Length-Preserving):**

- `swap-AB`: `#A ∷ B# ∷ xs ⇒ B# ∷ #A ∷ xs`

### **3. Analyzing the Impact of the New Rule**

#### **Interplay Between `swap-AB` and Existing Rules**

The new rule `swap-AB` allows us to swap `#A` and `B#` when they are adjacent:

- **Pattern Before Swap:** `#A B#`
- **After Applying `swap-AB`:** `B# #A`

Now, observe that the resulting pattern `B# #A` matches the existing `comm-BA` rule:

- `comm-BA`: `B# #A ⇒ #A B#`

Applying `comm-BA` swaps `B#` and `#A` back to `#A B#`.

#### **Infinite Reduction Cycle**

This creates a **loop** where the term can be reduced indefinitely:

1. **Starting Term:**

   ```
   ... #A ∷ B# ∷ ...
   ```

2. **Apply `swap-AB`:**

   ```
   ... #A ∷ B# ∷ ... ⇒ ... B# ∷ #A ∷ ...    (via swap-AB)
   ```

3. **Apply `comm-BA`:**

   ```
   ... B# ∷ #A ∷ ... ⇒ ... #A ∷ B# ∷ ...    (via comm-BA)
   ```

4. **Repeat Steps 2 and 3 Indefinitely:**

   ```
   ... #A ∷ B# ∷ ... ⇒ ... B# ∷ #A ∷ ... ⇒ ... #A ∷ B# ∷ ... ⇒ ...
   ```

#### **No Annihilation Occurs**

- **Annihilation rules** (`anni-AA` and `anni-BB`) do not apply to `#A B#` or `B# #A`.
- **Terms remain the same length**; no symbols are removed.

#### **Conclusion from the Cycle**

- The presence of this loop means that the term can be reduced infinitely without reaching a normal form.
- **Strong normalization fails** because there exists at least one term (`#A B#`) that can be part of an infinite reduction sequence.

### **4. Implications for Strong Normalization**

#### **Definition of Strong Normalization**

- A rewrite system is **strongly normalizing** if every sequence of reductions eventually terminates at a normal form (no infinite reduction sequences exist).

#### **Violation in the Modified AB System**

- The infinite loop between `#A B#` and `B# #A` demonstrates that the modified AB system is **not strongly normalizing**.
- Since at least one infinite reduction sequence exists, the property of strong normalization is lost.

### **5. Additional Considerations**

#### **No Additional Rules to Break the Loop**

- There are no rules in the system that could reduce `#A` or `B#` when they are not in the positions required for annihilation.
- The system lacks a mechanism to prevent or terminate the infinite loop created by the interplay of `swap-AB` and `comm-BA`.

#### **Other Potential Infinite Loops**

- Similar infinite cycles can occur with other combinations due to the presence of both swapping and commutation rules.
- **Example with `#B A#` (if a corresponding `swap` rule were added):**

  - Although not present in the current scenario, adding more swap rules could introduce further non-terminating sequences.

### **6. Conclusion**

- **Introducing the `swap-AB` rule `#A B# ⇒ B# #A` creates infinite reduction sequences.**
- **The AB system becomes non-normalizing**, as it no longer satisfies the condition that all reduction sequences terminate.
- **Strong normalization is thus violated** by the addition of the `swap-AB` rule.

**Therefore**, adding the `swap-AB` rule to the AB system makes it non-normalizing due to the introduction of infinite reduction cycles.

#Q6: This system is strongly normalizing. Would modifying the `anni-B` rule to `B# #B => #B A# A#` make it non-normalizing?

**Answer to Q6:**

No, modifying the `anni-B` rule to `B# ∷ #B ⇒ #B ∷ A# ∷ A#` **does not** make the system non-normalizing. The AB system remains **strongly normalizing** even with this modification. While the modified rule increases the term length, it does not introduce infinite reduction sequences. All reduction sequences still terminate after a finite number of steps.

---

**Explanation:**

To determine whether modifying the `anni-BB` rule affects the strong normalization of the AB system, we need to analyze the implications of the new rule and see if it allows for infinite reduction sequences.

### **1. Original and Modified Rules**

#### **Original Annihilation Rule for `B`:**

- **Rule Name:** `anni-BB`
- **Rule:** `B# ∷ #B ∷ xs ⇒ xs`  
  (Eliminates the pair `B# #B`)

#### **Modified Annihilation Rule for `B`:**

- **Rule Name:** `anni-B (modified)`
- **Rule:** `B# ∷ #B ∷ xs ⇒ #B ∷ A# ∷ A# ∷ xs`  
  (Replaces `B# #B` with `#B A# A#`)

### **2. Impact of the Modified Rule**

#### **Term Length Increase:**

- **Original Rule:** Reduces term length by 2 symbols.
- **Modified Rule:** Replaces 2 symbols (`B# #B`) with 3 symbols (`#B A# A#`), increasing term length by 1.

#### **Introduction of New Symbols:**

- The modified rule introduces `A#` symbols into the term, potentially creating new opportunities for reductions.

### **3. Analyzing Potential Infinite Reduction Sequences**

To see if the modified rule can lead to infinite reduction sequences, we need to:

- **Examine** whether the application of the modified rule can create new instances of `B# #B` that can be repeatedly reduced.
- **Determine** whether the term length can increase infinitely due to the repeated application of the modified rule.

#### **Step-by-Step Analysis:**

**Initial Term:** Let's consider a term containing `B# #B`.

**Applying Modified `anni-B` Rule:**

1. **First Reduction:**
   - **Before:** `B# #B ∷ xs`
   - **After:** `#B A# A# ∷ xs`

2. **Resulting Term:** The term now has an extra `A#` symbol. Term length increases by 1.

**Possible Reductions in the Resulting Term:**

- **Pair `#B A#`:** No reduction rule applies to `#B A#`.
- **Pair `A# A#`:** No reduction rule applies to `A# A#`.
- **No Immediate `B# #B` Pair:** The resulting term does not contain `B# #B` adjacent to each other.

**Attempting to Create `B# #B` Again:**

To have an infinite reduction sequence, we would need to rearrange or reduce the term to produce a new `B# #B` pair. Let's consider the following possibilities:

1. **Using Commutation and Annihilation Rules:**
   - **Commutation Rules:**
     - `comm-AB`: `A# ∷ #B ∷ xs ⇒ #B ∷ A# ∷ xs`  
       (Requires `A# #B` pattern)
     - `comm-BA`: `B# ∷ #A ∷ xs ⇒ #A ∷ B# ∷ xs`  
       (Requires `B# #A` pattern)
   - **Annihilation Rule for `A`:**
     - `anni-AA`: `A# ∷ #A ∷ xs ⇒ xs`  
       (Requires `A# #A` pattern)

2. **Examining the Resulting Term:**

   - **Term After First Reduction:** `#B ∷ A# ∷ A# ∷ xs`
   - **Possible Pairs:**
     - `#B A#`: No reduction applies.
     - `A# A#`: No reduction applies.
     - No `A# #B` or `B# #A` patterns to apply commutation.
     - No `A# #A` pattern to apply `anni-AA`.

3. **Conclusion:** We cannot create a new `B# #B` pair from the resulting term using the available rules.

**Extending the Analysis:**

- **Multiple `B# #B` Pairs:**

  - **Initial Term:** `(B# ∷ #B)ⁿ ∷ xs`
  - **After Applying Modified Rule to Each Pair:**
    - Each `B# #B` becomes `#B A# A#`
    - Term length increases from `2n` to `3n`
  - **Resulting Term:** A series of `#B ∷ A# ∷ A#` units.

- **Attempting to Create `B# #B` Again:**
  - Similar to the earlier case, the resulting term does not contain adjacent `B# #B`.
  - No combination of commutation and annihilation rules will rearrange the term to produce `B# #B`.

### **4. Key Observations**

#### **No Infinite Length Increase:**

- The number of `B# #B` pairs in the original term is finite.
- Each application of the modified rule consumes an existing `B# #B` pair.
- The term length increases by 1 per application, but the process cannot continue indefinitely because we cannot create new `B# #B` pairs.

#### **No Creation of New `B# #B` Pairs:**

- Without the ability to generate new `B# #B` pairs, we cannot reapply the modified rule infinitely.
- The term eventually reaches a point where no further reductions are possible.

#### **Term Length Remains Finite:**

- Although term length increases during reduction, it remains finite.
- The initial number of `B# #B` pairs is finite, limiting the maximum possible term length after reductions.

### **5. Conclusion**

- **No Infinite Reduction Sequences:** The modified rule does not introduce infinite reduction sequences because it cannot be applied indefinitely.
- **All Reduction Paths Terminate:** Every sequence of reductions eventually reaches a normal form where no further rules apply.
- **Strong Normalization Still Holds:** The AB system remains strongly normalizing despite the modification to the `anni-B` rule.

### **6. Final Remarks**

- **Length-Increasing Rules and Normalization:**
  - The presence of length-increasing rules does not necessarily lead to non-termination.
  - What matters is whether the rules allow for infinite application without reaching a normal form.
- **Importance of Rule Interactions:**
  - The inability to recreate the conditions necessary to reapply the modified rule ensures termination.
  - The interactions between rules must be carefully analyzed to determine their impact on normalization.

---

**Therefore**, modifying the `anni-B` rule to `B# ∷ #B ⇒ #B ∷ A# ∷ A#` does **not** make the AB system non-normalizing. The system remains strongly normalizing because all reduction sequences terminate after a finite number of steps, and infinite reductions are not possible.

#Q7: Is there any term with length 4 that normalizes to a term with length 1?

**Answer to Q7:**

No, there is **no term of length 4 that normalizes to a term of length 1** in the AB system. Due to the nature of the reduction rules, specifically the way they affect term lengths, it's impossible for a term of length 4 to reduce to a term of length 1. The reductions can only decrease the term length by multiples of 2, and thus, a length reduction from 4 to 1 cannot occur.

---

**Explanation:**

To understand why such a reduction is impossible, let's analyze the reduction rules of the AB system and how they impact the lengths of terms.

### **1. The Reduction Rules and Term Lengths**

#### **Reduction Rules:**

1. **Annihilation Rules (Length-Decreasing):**
   - `anni-AA`: `A# ∷ #A ∷ xs ⇒ xs`
     - **Effect:** Removes two symbols (`A#` and `#A`), reducing the term length by 2.
   - `anni-BB`: `B# ∷ #B ∷ xs ⇒ xs`
     - **Effect:** Removes two symbols (`B#` and `#B`), reducing the term length by 2.

2. **Commutation Rules (Length-Preserving):**
   - `comm-AB`: `A# ∷ #B ∷ xs ⇒ #B ∷ A# ∷ xs`
     - **Effect:** Swaps adjacent symbols but does not change the term length.
   - `comm-BA`: `B# ∷ #A ∷ xs ⇒ #A ∷ B# ∷ xs`
     - **Effect:** Swaps adjacent symbols but does not change the term length.

### **2. Possible Term Lengths After Reductions**

Given the reduction rules:

- **Annihilation Rules** can only decrease the term length by **2** at a time.
- **Commutation Rules** **do not change** the term length.
- **No rules exist** to remove a single symbol or decrease the term length by 1.

### **3. Starting from a Term of Length 4**

#### **Possible Lengths After Reductions:**

- **Initial Term Length:** 4 symbols.
- **After Zero or More Reductions:**
  - **Length 4:** If only commutation rules are applied.
  - **Length 2:** If one annihilation rule is applied (length decreases by 2).
  - **Length 0:** If two annihilation rules are applied (length decreases by 4).
- **Impossible Lengths:** 3 or 1.

#### **Reasoning:**

- **Cannot Achieve Length 1:**
  - There is no way to reduce the term length from 4 to 1 because the annihilation rules can only reduce lengths by multiples of 2.
  - No combination of reductions allows for a term length reduction of **3**, which would be necessary to go from length 4 to length 1.

### **4. Attempting to Find a Counterexample**

Suppose we try to find a term of length 4 that might reduce to length 1:

- **Example Term:** Let's consider all possible combinations, but focus on ones that might allow maximum reductions.

#### **Possible Scenarios:**

1. **Term with Two Annihilation Pairs:**

   - **Term:** `A# ∷ #A ∷ B# ∷ #B`
   - **Reductions:**
     - Apply `anni-AA`: `A# #A ⇒ xs` (term becomes `B# #B`)
     - Apply `anni-BB`: `B# #B ⇒ xs` (term becomes `[]`, length 0)

   - **Result:** Term length reduces from 4 to 0 (not 1)

2. **Term with One Annihilation Pair:**

   - **Term:** `A# ∷ #A ∷ A# ∷ B#`
   - **Reductions:**
     - Apply `anni-AA`: `A# #A ⇒ xs` (term becomes `A# B#`)
     - No further annihilations apply.
     - **Final Length:** 2

3. **Term Requiring Commutation Before Annihilation:**

   - **Term:** `A# ∷ #B ∷ B# ∷ #A`
   - **Reductions:**
     - Apply `comm-AB`: `A# #B ⇒ #B A#` (term becomes `#B ∷ A# ∷ B# ∷ #A`)
     - Apply `comm-BA`: `B# #A ⇒ #A B#` (term becomes `#B ∷ A# ∷ #A ∷ B#`)
     - Apply `anni-AA`: `A# #A ⇒ xs` (term becomes `#B ∷ B#`)
     - Apply `anni-BB`: `B# #B ⇒ xs` (after rearrangement)
     - **Final Length:** Either 0 or 2, depending on the order of reductions.

- **Conclusion:** No matter how the reductions are applied, the term length cannot reach 1.

### **5. Conclusion**

- **Reduction Lengths Are Even:**
  - Since annihilations remove pairs of symbols (even number), the term length reductions are always even.
- **Length 1 Is Not Achievable:**
  - Starting from length 4, the term can only reduce to lengths of 4, 2, or 0 after reductions.
  - Length 1 cannot be achieved because it would require removing an odd number of symbols, which is impossible with the given rules.

---

**Therefore**, in the AB system, there's **no term of length 4** that normalizes to a term of length **1**. All term length reductions are by even numbers, and it's impossible to reduce the term length by exactly 3 symbols starting from a term of length 4.

#Q8: What is the maximum number of steps that a term with length 6 can require to reach normal form?

**Answer to Q8:**

The maximum number of steps that a term with length 6 can require to reach normal form in the AB system is **9**.

---

**Explanation:**

To find the maximum number of steps required to normalize a term of length 6 in the AB system, we'll consider the worst-case scenario where:

- **Annihilations require the maximum number of commutation steps** to bring the annihilating pairs together.
- **Commutation steps are maximized** before each annihilation.

### **1. Understanding the Reduction Rules**

**Reduction Rules Recap:**

1. **Annihilation Rules (Length-Decreasing):**
   - `anni-AA`: `A# ∷ #A ∷ xs ⇒ xs`  
     (Removes two symbols, reducing term length by 2)
   - `anni-BB`: `B# ∷ #B ∷ xs ⇒ xs`  
     (Removes two symbols, reducing term length by 2)

2. **Commutation Rules (Length-Preserving):**
   - `comm-AB`: `A# ∷ #B ∷ xs ⇒ #B ∷ A# ∷ xs`  
     (Swaps `A#` and `#B`)
   - `comm-BA`: `B# ∷ #A ∷ xs ⇒ #A ∷ B# ∷ xs`  
     (Swaps `B#` and `#A`)

**Important Note:**

- Reduction rules **only apply** to specific adjacent pairs.
- No reductions apply to other symbol combinations.

### **2. Constructing a Worst-Case Term**

To maximize the number of steps:

- **Arrange annihilating pairs at opposite ends** of the term.
- **Maximize the distance** between pairs needing to be annihilated.
- **Include symbols in between** that require commutation steps to move annihilating symbols together.

**Worst-Case Term of Length 6:**

```
Term Positions: [1]   [2]   [3]   [4]   [5]   [6]
Symbols:         A#   #B    A#    #B    B#    #A
```

This term has:

- Two potential annihilation pairs:
  - `A# #A` (positions to be adjacent)
  - `B# #B` (positions to be adjacent)
- Symbols arranged to require multiple commutations.

### **3. Step-by-Step Reduction**

- **Resulting Term:**

3: A#
4: A#
5: #A
6: B#
```

**Total Steps: 4**

---

**Step 5: Apply `comm-AB` at positions 3 and 4 (`A# #A`)**

- **No action:** The pair is `A# A#`, no commutation applies.

**Proceed to next possible commutation.**

**Step 5 (continued): Apply `anni-AA` at positions 3 and 4 (`A# A#`)**

- **No action:** `anni-AA` applies to `A# #A`, not `A# A#`.

**Proceed to next possible reduction.**

---

**Step 6: Apply `anni-BB` at positions 1 and 2 (`#B #B`)**

- **No action:** `anni-BB` applies to `B# #B`, not `#B #B`.

**Proceed to rearrange to create annihilation opportunities.**

---

**Step 6: Apply `comm-BA` at positions 4 and 5 (`A# #A`)**

- **Action:** Not applicable. `comm-BA` applies to `B# #A`.

---

**Step 6 (Alternative): Apply `comm-AB` at positions 3 and 4 (`A# A#`)**

- **No action:** Not applicable.

---

**Step 6: Apply `anni-AA` at positions 3 and 5 (`A# #A`)**

- **Symbols not adjacent**, cannot apply `anni-AA`.

---

**Step 6: Rearrangement Needed**

- To create an adjacent `A# #A` pair, we need to swap `A#` at position 4 with `#A` at position 5.

**Step 6: Apply `comm-AB` at positions 4 and 5 (`A# #A`)**

- **No action:** `comm-AB` applies to `A# #B`, not `A# #A`.

---

**Observation:**

- The term cannot be further reduced without additional commutations.

**Step 6: Apply `comm-BA` at positions 5 and 6 (`#A B#`)**

- **No action:** `comm-BA` applies to `B# #A`, not `#A B#`.

---

**Conclusion:**

- The above term cannot reach normal form in 9 steps because certain reductions are not applicable due to the limited applicability of the commutation rules.

### **4. Corrected Approach**

Let's construct a term where all possible commutation steps can be applied before each annihilation.

**Revised Worst-Case Term:**

```
1: B#
2: #A
3: A#
4: #B
5: A#
6: #B
```

**Annihilation Pairs:**

- `A# #A` (positions need to be adjacent)
- `B# #B` (positions need to be adjacent)

---

**Step-by-Step Reduction (Maximum Steps):**

**Total Steps: 0**

---

**Step 1: Apply `comm-BA` at positions 1 and 2 (`B# #A`)**

- **Swap:** `B# #A` ⇒ `#A B#`
- **Result:**

1: #A

```

**Total Steps: 2**

---

**Step 3: Apply `comm-AB` at positions 2 and 3 (`B# #B`)**

- **No action:** `comm-AB` applies to `A# #B`.

**Step 3: Apply `anni-BB` at positions 2 and 3 (`B# #B`)**

- **Annihilate:** `B# #B` ⇒ `[]`
- **Result:**

```
1: #A
2: A#
3: A#
4: #B
```

**Total Steps: 3**

---

4: A#
```

**Total Steps: 4**

---

**Step 5: Apply `anni-AA` at positions 1 and 2 (`#A A#`)**

- **No action:** `anni-AA` applies to `A# #A`.

**Step 5: Apply `comm-BA` at positions 1 and 2 (`#A A#`)**

- **No action:** `comm-BA` applies to `B# #A`.

---

**Step 5: Move `#A` to make `A# #A` adjacent**

- **Cannot swap `#A` and `A#` directly.**

- **No applicable commutation rules.**

---

**Conclusion:**

Despite our efforts, the maximum number of steps seems to be less than our initial assumption.

### **5. Maximum Number of Steps Determination**

Given the limitations of the commutation rules and the inability to create certain configurations, the practical maximum number of steps for a term of length 6 is:

- **A maximum of 5 steps:**

  - **3 commutation steps**
  - **2 annihilation steps**

### **Final Answer:**

The maximum number of steps that a term with length 6 can require to reach normal form is **5**.

---

**Revised Answer to Q8:**

After careful analysis, the maximum number of steps that a term with length 6 can require to reach normal form in the AB system is **5**.

#Q9: In general, given a term with length 2N, what is the maximum number of steps to reach normal form?

**Answer to Q9:**

The maximum number of steps that a term with length \( 2N \) can require to reach normal form in the AB system is **\( N(N - 1) \)**.

---

**Explanation:**

To determine the maximum number of steps required to reduce a term of length \( 2N \) to its normal form in the AB system, we'll analyze how the worst-case scenario unfolds during the reduction process. The key factors in maximizing the number of steps are:

1. **Annihilation Pairs are Far Apart:**
   - Arrange the term such that the symbols that need to annihilate are as far apart as possible.
   - This maximizes the number of commutation steps needed to bring them together.

2. **Commutation Steps are Maximized:**
   - Since commutation rules only swap specific adjacent symbol pairs, moving symbols over longer distances requires multiple commutation steps.
   - Each commutation step swaps adjacent symbols according to the rules, and we aim to maximize these steps.

---

### **1. Understanding the Reduction Mechanics**

#### **Symbols and Reduction Rules**

- **Symbols in the AB System:** `A#`, `#A`, `B#`, `#B`.
- **Annihilation Rules (Length-Decreasing):**
  - `anni-AA`: `A# ∷ #A ∷ xs ⇒ xs` (removes `A# #A`, reduces length by 2).
  - `anni-BB`: `B# ∷ #B ∷ xs ⇒ xs` (removes `B# #B`, reduces length by 2).
- **Commutation Rules (Length-Preserving):**
  - `comm-AB`: `A# ∷ #B ∷ xs ⇒ #B ∷ A# ∷ xs` (swaps `A#` and `#B`).
  - `comm-BA`: `B# ∷ #A ∷ xs ⇒ #A ∷ B# ∷ xs` (swaps `B#` and `#A`).

#### **Constraints**

- **Interactions Only Occur with Internal `#`:**
  - Pairs interact (can be reduced) when the `#` is internal, e.g., `A# #A`.
  - Pairs like `#A A#` do not interact directly.

---

### **2. Constructing the Worst-Case Term**

To maximize the number of steps:

- **Arrange N Annihilation Pairs Among 2N Symbols.**
- **Separate Each Annihilating Pair by the Maximum Possible Distance.**
- **Interleave Symbols to Require Maximum Commutations.**

#### **Example Construction for Length \( 2N \)**

Let's construct a term where:

- The term has length \( 2N \).
- There are \( N \) `A#` symbols that need to be annihilated with `#A` symbols.
- The `A#` and `#A` symbols are placed at opposite ends to maximize distance.

**Term Structure:**

- **Positions 1 to N:** `A#` symbols.
- **Positions N+1 to 2N:** `#A` symbols.

**Term Representation:**

```
Positions:   [1]   [2]   [3]   ...   [N]   [N+1]   [N+2]   ...   [2N]
Symbols:     A#    A#    A#    ...   A#    #A      #A      ...   #A
```

---

### **3. Calculating the Maximum Number of Steps**

#### **Number of Annihilation Steps**

- **Each Annihilation Removes 2 Symbols:**
  - Total of \( N \) annihilation steps.
  - Each step reduces the term length by 2.

#### **Number of Commutation Steps**

To bring each `A#` together with its corresponding `#A`, we need to move it past other symbols using commutation rules.

##### **Commutation Steps for Each Pair**

- **For the \( i \)-th `A#` (from the left):**
  - It needs to move past \( N \) `#A` symbols to reach its annihilation partner.
- **Number of Swaps Needed for the \( i \)-th `A#`:**
  - **Swap Steps per `A#`:** \( N \) swaps.
  - **Total Swaps for All `A#`:** \( N \times N \).

But due to the commutation rules' constraints, not all swaps are directly possible. We need to account for the allowable swaps.

##### **Adjusting for Valid Swaps**

- **Only Specific Swaps Are Allowed:**
  - `A#` can swap with `#B` (not present in this term).
  - `B#` can swap with `#A` (not present).
- **Swaps Between `A#` and `#A` Are Not Directly Allowed.**

##### **Introducing `B` Symbols to Enable Swaps**

To maximize the number of commutation steps, we need to include `B` symbols that facilitate swaps.

**Revised Term with Interleaved Symbols:**

- **Positions 1 to N:** Alternating `A#`, `B#`.
- **Positions N+1 to 2N:** Alternating `#B`, `#A`.

**Term Representation:**

```
Positions: [1]   [2]   [3]   [4]   ...   [2N-1]   [2N]
Symbols:   A#    B#    A#    B#    ...     B#      A#
Positions: [2N+1] [2N+2] [2N+3] [2N+4] ... [4N-1] [4N]
Symbols:   #B     #A     #B     #A     ...   #A     #B
```

However, in terms of length, this creates a term of length \( 4N \), exceeding our length constraint.

Since we must work within a term of length \( 2N \), we cannot exploit `B` symbols for swapping in the initial assumption.

---

### **4. Realistic Maximum Commutation Steps**

Given the restrictions, the maximum commutation steps are limited.

#### **Alternative Approach**

- **Recognize that Swaps Cannot Occur Between `A#` and `#A` Directly.**
- **Commutation Rules Require Both `A` and `B` Symbols.**
- **We Must Include `B` Symbols to Maximize Steps.**

#### **Constructing a Term Incorporating `B` Symbols**

**Term Structure:**

- **Positions 1 to N:** `A#` symbols.
- **Positions N+1 to 2N:** `#B` symbols.
- **Positions 2N+1 to 3N:** `B#` symbols.
- **Positions 3N+1 to 4N:** `#A` symbols.

**Note:** This term now has length \( 4N \), but it allows us to use commutation rules effectively.

**Term Representation:**

```
[A#]...[A#] [#B]...[#B] [B#]...[B#] [#A]...[#A]
```

However, this again exceeds the length constraint.

#### **Accepting Practical Limits**

Since we cannot increase the term length, we need to accept that:

- **The Maximum Number of Steps is Limited by the Number of Possible Swaps.**
- **In a Length \( 2N \) Term, the Maximum Steps is \( N(N - 1) \).**

---

### **5. Calculation of Maximum Steps**

**Maximum Number of Annihilation Steps:**

- **Total Annihilation Steps:** \( N \)

**Maximum Number of Commutation Steps:**

- For each annihilation pair, the maximum number of necessary commutation steps is \( N - 1 \).
- **Total Commutation Steps:** \( N \times (N - 1) \)

---

**Therefore, the maximum total number of steps is:**

\[
\text{Total Steps} = \text{Total Commutation Steps} + \text{Total Annihilation Steps} = N(N - 1) + N = N^2
\]

But since some commutation steps may not be needed due to rule constraints, the realistic maximum is \( N(N - 1) \).

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Maximum Number of Steps for a Term of Length \( 2N \):** \( N(N - 1) \)
- **This Accounts for the Maximum Number of Commutation Steps Plus Annihilation Steps.**

---

**Example for \( N = 4 \):**

- **Term Length:** 8
- **Maximum Steps:** \( 4(4 - 1) = 12 \) steps

This aligns with the pattern where the maximum number of steps grows quadratically with \( N \).

### **Final Answer**

The maximum number of steps that a term with length \( 2N \) can require to reach normal form in the AB system is **\( N(N - 1) \)**.



RESULT:

- Q0: What's the normal form of `#A A# #B A# A# B# B# #A #B B# #A B# #B`?
- A0: #A #B A# B# B#, by reduction.
- J0: User correctly reduced the term to #A #B A# B# B# through systematic application of reduction rules, matching the reference answer.
- S0: 1

- Q1: Is the AB system strongly normalizing?
- A1: Yes, because annis decrease the length, and comms can't produce infinite loops.
- J1: User correctly states the AB system is strongly normalizing, explaining that annihilations decrease length and commutations can't produce infinite loops.
- S1: 1

- Q2: In a normalized term starting with `#A B#`, which symbols can occur afterwards?
- A2: A# and B#, because other symbols would trigger reductions.
- J2: User correctly states that only A# and B# can occur after #A B# in a normalized term, explaining that other symbols would trigger reductions.
- S2: 1

- Q3: In a normalized term starting with `A#`, which symbols can NOT occur afterwards?
- A3: #B and #A, because they would trigger reductions.
- J3: User correctly states that #B and #A cannot occur after A# in a normalized term, explaining that these symbols would trigger reductions.
- S3: 1

- Q4: This system is strongly normalizing. Would allowing only inputs with a single letter type make it non-normalizing?
- A4: No, the system would remain strongly normalizing, because it is a subset of a normalizing system.
- J4: User correctly states that allowing only inputs with a single letter type does not make the system non-normalizing, explaining that it remains strongly normalizing due to reduced complexity and finite reduction sequences.
- S4: 1

- Q5: This system is strongly normalizing. Would introducing the `swap-AB` rule: `#A B# => B# #A` make it non-normalizing?
- A5: Yes, the system would become non-normalizing, since comms and swap can mutually result in infinite loops.
- J5: User correctly states that introducing the swap-AB rule would make the system non-normalizing, explaining that it creates infinite loops when combined with existing commutation rules.
- S5: 1

- Q6: This system is strongly normalizing. Would modifying the `anni-B` rule to `B# #B => #B A# A#` make it non-normalizing?
- A6: No, the system would remain strongly normalizing, despite the rule increasing in length. That's because we'll eventually run out of B# symbols to trigger `anni-B` rules.
- J6: User correctly states that modifying the anni-B rule to B# #B => #B A# A# does not make the system non-normalizing, explaining that despite increasing term length, B# symbols will eventually run out, preventing infinite reductions.
- S6: 1

- Q7: Is there any term with length 4 that normalizes to a term with length 1?
- A7: No, because each step can only decrease the size by 2.
- J7: User correctly states that no term of length 4 can normalize to a term of length 1, explaining that reductions can only decrease the term length by multiples of 2.
- S7: 1

- Q8: What is the maximum number of steps that a term with length 6 can require to reach normal form?
- A8: In the worst cases (such as `A# A# A# #B #B #B`), 9 steps.
- J8: User incorrectly concludes that the maximum number of steps for a term of length 6 to reach normal form is 5, based on analysis of commutation and annihilation rules, which differs from the reference answer of 9 steps.
- S8: 0

- Q9: In general, given a term with length 2N, what is the maximum number of steps to reach normal form?
- A9: In the worst cases (such as `A# A# ... #B #B`), N^2 steps.
- J9: User incorrectly concludes that the maximum number of steps for a term of length 2N to reach normal form is N(N-1), based on analysis of commutation and annihilation steps, which differs from the reference answer of N^2 steps.
- S9: 0
