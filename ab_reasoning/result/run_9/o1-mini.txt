Let an AB symbol be one of 4 possible variants:

  data AB : Set where
    A# : AB
    #A : AB
    B# : AB
    #B : AB

Let an AB Term be a list of AB symbols:

  Term : Set = List AB

An AB system computes via the following step reduction relation:

  data _=>_ : List AB → List AB → Set where
    comm-AB : ∀ xs → (A# ∷ #B ∷ xs) => (#B ∷ A# ∷ xs)
    comm-BA : ∀ xs → (B# ∷ #A ∷ xs) => (#A ∷ B# ∷ xs)
    anni-AA : ∀ xs → (A# ∷ #A ∷ xs) => xs
    anni-BB : ∀ xs → (B# ∷ #B ∷ xs) => xs

An AB term is in normal form if it can't be reduced further.

For example, the normal form of the term below can be computed in 3 steps:

  B# A# #B #A B#
  -------------- comm-AB
  B# #B A# #А B#
  -------------- anni-BB
  A# #А B#
  -------- anni-AA
  B#

Note that a pair only interacts when the '#' is internal.
For example, 'A# #A' interacts, but '#A A#' does not.

Your goal is to answer logical questions about this system. Can we start?

Absolutely, let's get started! Feel free to ask any questions you have about the AB system, its reduction rules, normal forms, or any other related topics. I'm here to help clarify and explore the system with you.

#Q0: What's the normal form of `#A A# #B A# A# B# B# #A #B B# #A B# #B`?

To find the **normal form** of the AB term `#A A# #B A# A# B# B# #A #B B# #A B# #B`, we'll systematically apply the reduction rules until no further reductions are possible.

### **Given AB Term:**
```
#A A# #B A# A# B# B# #A #B B# #A B# #B
```

### **Reduction Rules:**
1. **comm-AB:** `A# #B` → `#B A#`
2. **comm-BA:** `B# #A` → `#A B#`
3. **anni-AA:** `A# #A` → (eliminate both)
4. **anni-BB:** `B# #B` → (eliminate both)

### **Step-by-Step Reduction:**

1. **Initial Term:**
   ```
   #A A# #B A# A# B# B# #A #B B# #A B# #B
   ```

2. **Apply comm-AB on `A# #B`:**
   ```
   #A #B A# A# B# B# #A #B B# #A B# #B
   ```

3. **Apply comm-BA on `B# #A`:**
   ```
   #A #B A# A# #A B# B# #B B# #A B# #B
   ```

4. **Apply anni-AA on `A# #A`:**
   ```
   #A #B B# B# #B B# #A B# #B
   ```

5. **Apply anni-BB on `B# #B`:**
   ```
   #A #B B# B#
   ```

6. **No further reductions are possible.**

### **Normal Form:**
```
#A #B B# B#
```

This is the **normal form** of the given AB term, as it cannot be reduced further using the provided rules.

#Q1: Is the AB system strongly normalizing?

Yes, the **AB system is strongly normalizing**. Here's a detailed explanation to understand why this is the case.

### **Understanding Strong Normalization**

A system is **strongly normalizing** if **every** possible reduction sequence starting from any valid term **eventually terminates** in a normal form (a term where no more reductions are possible).

### **Analyzing the AB System**

Let's break down the AB system to see why it satisfies strong normalization:

1. **Reduction Rules:**
   
   - **Commutation Rules:**
     - `comm-AB`: `A# :: #B :: xs ⇒ #B :: A# :: xs`
     - `comm-BA`: `B# :: #A :: xs ⇒ #A :: B# :: xs`
   
   - **Annihilation Rules:**
     - `anni-AA`: `A# :: #A :: xs ⇒ xs`
     - `anni-BB`: `B# :: #B :: xs ⇒ xs`

2. **Potential for Infinite Reduction:**
   
   - **Commutation Rules (`comm-AB` and `comm-BA`)** allow symbols to reorder without changing the length of the term.
   - However, these reordering operations **do not inherently create cycles** that could lead to infinite reductions. Each commutation brings the term closer to a configuration where annihilation rules can be applied.
   
   - **Annihilation Rules (`anni-AA` and `anni-BB`)** **reduce the length** of the term by eliminating pairs of symbols (`A#` with `#A` and `B#` with `#B`).

3. **Termination Argument:**
   
   - **Non-Increasing Term Length:** Commutation rules maintain the term length, while annihilation rules strictly **decrease** it.
   
   - **Finite Term Length:** Since the term length is a natural number and cannot increase, repeated application of annihilation rules will eventually terminate the reduction process.
   
   - **No Cycles:** Commutation alone does not create infinite cycles because once terms are reordered, they either reach a state where annihilation can occur or reach a normal form without further applicable reductions.

4. **Example Walkthrough:**
   
   Consider the term: `A# #B A# #B A# #B`

   - **Step 1:** Apply `comm-AB` on the first `A# #B`:
     ```
     #B A# #B A# #B A#
     ```
   
   - **Step 2:** No further commutations are possible immediately, but if there are `A# #B` pairs later in the term, they can be commuted similarly.
   
   - **Step 3:** Eventually, if pairs like `A# #A` or `B# #B` appear, annihilation rules can be applied to reduce the term further.
   
   - **Termination:** The reduction continues until no more commutations or annihilations are possible, ensuring termination.

### **Conclusion**

Given the above analysis:

- **Every reduction step either maintains or decreases the term length.**
- **Reduction sequences cannot cycle infinitely without making progress towards a normal form.**

Therefore, **the AB system is strongly normalizing**, guaranteeing that every valid term will terminate in its normal form after a finite number of reduction steps.

#Q2: In a normalized term starting with `#A B#`, which symbols can occur afterwards?

To determine which symbols can occur **after** `#A B#` in a **normalized term** within the AB system, we need to consider the system's reduction rules and the constraints they impose on the term's structure.

### **Recap of the AB System**

- **AB Symbols:**
  - `A#`
  - `#A`
  - `B#`
  - `#B`

- **Reduction Rules:**
  1. **comm-AB:** 
     \[
     A# \, :: \, \#B \, :: \, \text{xs} \Rightarrow \#B \, :: \, A# \, :: \, \text{xs}
     \]
  2. **comm-BA:**
     \[
     B# \, :: \, \#A \, :: \, \text{xs} \Rightarrow \#A \, :: \, B# \, :: \, \text{xs}
     \]
  3. **anni-AA:**
     \[
     A# \, :: \, \#A \, :: \, \text{xs} \Rightarrow \text{xs}
     \]
  4. **anni-BB:**
     \[
     B# \, :: \, \#B \, :: \, \text{xs} \Rightarrow \text{xs}
     \]

### **Understanding Normal Forms**

A **normalized term** is one where **no reduction rules can be applied**. This means:

- **No adjacent pairs** in the term match the left-hand side of any reduction rule.
- Specifically:
  - No `A# #A` or `B# #B` (to avoid annihilation).
  - No `A# #B` or `B# #A` (to avoid unnecessary commutations).

### **Analyzing the Term Starting with `#A B#`**

Consider a normalized term that **begins** with `#A B#`. We need to determine which symbols can legally follow these two symbols without violating the normalization constraints.

Let's denote the term as:
\[
\#A \, B# \, x_1 \, x_2 \, \ldots \, x_n
\]

**Constraints on the Immediate Next Symbol (`x₁`):**

1. **Adjacent Pair Analysis:**
   - The second symbol is `B#`.
   - The third symbol (`x₁`) must **not** form a reducible pair with `B#`.
   
2. **Possible Issues with `x₁`:**
   - If \( x_1 = \#A \):
     - The pair `B# #A` matches the left-hand side of the **comm-BA** rule.
     - This would allow the term to be reduced, contradicting the assumption that the term is in normal form.
   
   - If \( x_1 = \#B \):
     - The pair `B# #B` matches the left-hand side of the **anni-BB** rule.
     - This would allow annihilation, again contradicting the normalization.
   
   - Therefore, \( x_1 \) **cannot** be `#A` or `#B`.

3. **Allowed Symbols for `x₁`:**
   - **`A#`:**
     - The pair `B# A#` **does not** match any reduction rule.
     - Allows the term to remain in normal form.
   
   - **`B#`:**
     - The pair `B# B#` **does not** trigger any reduction rules.
     - Multiple `B#` symbols are allowed as long as they are not followed by `#B`.

4. **Conclusion for `x₁`:**
   - Only `A#` and `B#` can follow `#A B#` without introducing reducible pairs.

### **Extending Beyond the Immediate Next Symbol**

While the question specifically asks about symbols **immediately following** `#A B#`, it's worth noting that:

- Subsequent symbols (e.g., \( x_2, x_3, \ldots \)) must continue to respect the normalization constraints.
- Each new symbol added must not create reducible adjacent pairs with its predecessor.

### **Summary**

- **Immediate Next Symbols After `#A B#` in a Normalized Term:**
  - **Allowed:** `A#`, `B#`
  - **Disallowed:** `#A`, `#B` (to prevent possible reductions)

### **Final Answer**

Only the symbols A# and B# may follow after #A B# in a normalized AB term.

#Q3: In a normalized term starting with `A#`, which symbols can NOT occur afterwards?

In a **normalized AB term** starting with `A#`, certain symbols cannot follow `A#` immediately without violating the normalization constraints. To determine **which symbols cannot occur after `A#`**, let's analyze the system's reduction rules and how they affect term formation.

### **Recap of the AB System**

- **AB Symbols:**
  - `A#`
  - `#A`
  - `B#`
  - `#B`

- **Reduction Rules:**
  1. **comm-AB:**
     \[
     A# \ :: \ #B \ :: \ \text{xs} \Rightarrow #B \ :: \ A# \ :: \ \text{xs}
     \]
  2. **comm-BA:**
     \[
     B# \ :: \ #A \ :: \ \text{xs} \Rightarrow #A \ :: \ B# \ :: \ \text{xs}
     \]
  3. **anni-AA:**
     \[
     A# \ :: \ #A \ :: \ \text{xs} \Rightarrow \text{xs}
     \]
  4. **anni-BB:**
     \[
     B# \ :: \ #B \ :: \ \text{xs} \Rightarrow \text{xs}
     \]

### **Understanding Normal Forms**

A **normalized term** is one where **no reduction rules can be applied**. This means:

- **No adjacent pairs** in the term match the left-hand side of any reduction rule.
- Specifically:
  - No `A# #A` or `B# #B` (to avoid annihilation via `anni-AA` or `anni-BB`).
  - No `A# #B` or `B# #A` (to avoid commutations via `comm-AB` or `comm-BA`).

### **Analyzing the Term Starting with `A#`**

Consider a normalized term that **begins** with `A#`. We need to determine **which symbols cannot follow** `A#` without introducing reducible patterns.

#### **Possible Symbols to Follow `A#`:**

1. **`A#`:**
   - **Pair:** `A# A#`
   - **Analysis:** This pair does **not** trigger any reduction rules.
   - **Conclusion:** Allowed.

2. **`B#`:**
   - **Pair:** `A# B#`
   - **Analysis:** This pair does **not** directly trigger reduction rules.
   - **Potential for Reduction:** While `A# B#` itself is not directly reducible, subsequent symbols could introduce reducible patterns. However, as an immediate pair, it's allowed.
   - **Conclusion:** Allowed.

3. **`#A`:**
   - **Pair:** `A# #A`
   - **Analysis:** This pair matches the left-hand side of the **anni-AA** rule.
   - **Conclusion:** **Not allowed** in a normalized term as it would allow the pair to be annihilated.

4. **`#B`:**
   - **Pair:** `A# #B`
   - **Analysis:** This pair matches the left-hand side of the **comm-AB** rule.
   - **Conclusion:** **Not allowed** in a normalized term as it would allow the pair to be commuted.

### **Summary of Forbidden Symbols**

- **Symbols That **Cannot** Follow `A#` in a Normalized Term:**
  - **`#A`**
  - **`#B`**

- **Symbols That **Can** Follow `A#` in a Normalized Term:**
  - **`A#`**
  - **`B#`**

### **Final Answer**

**In a normalized AB term beginning with A#, the symbols #A and #B cannot follow A#.**

#Q4: This system is strongly normalizing. Would allowing only inputs with a single letter type make it non-normalizing?

No, **restricting the AB system to inputs with only a single letter type does not make it non-normalizing**. In fact, the system remains **strongly normalizing** even under this restriction. Here's a detailed explanation to clarify why this is the case.

---

### **Understanding the AB System**

Recall the **AB system** is defined with the following components:

- **AB Symbols:**
  - `A#`
  - `#A`
  - `B#`
  - `#B`

- **Reduction Rules:**
  1. **Commutation Rules:**
     - `comm-AB`: `A# :: #B :: xs ⇒ #B :: A# :: xs`
     - `comm-BA`: `B# :: #A :: xs ⇒ #A :: B# :: xs`
  
  2. **Annihilation Rules:**
     - `anni-AA`: `A# :: #A :: xs ⇒ xs`
     - `anni-BB`: `B# :: #B :: xs ⇒ xs`

- **Normal Forms:**
  - A term is in normal form if no adjacent pair of symbols matches the left-hand side of any reduction rule.

---

### **Single Letter Type Restriction**

**Restricting to a Single Letter Type** means that all symbols in the input term are of only one type, either:

- **Type A Only:** Symbols are limited to `A#` and `#A`.
  
  **OR**
  
- **Type B Only:** Symbols are limited to `B#` and `#B`.

This means that in any given input term, only one set of annihilation rules (`anni-AA` or `anni-BB`) applies, and the corresponding commutation rules become irrelevant because the other letter type isn't present.

---

### **Analyzing Strong Normalization Under Single Letter Type**

**Strong Normalization** ensures that every possible reduction sequence starting from any valid term **terminates** in a normal form.

1. **When Restricted to Type A Only:**
   - **Available Symbols:** `A#` and `#A`.
   - **Applicable Reduction Rules:** Only `anni-AA` can be applied (`A# :: #A ⇒ ε`).
   - **Behavior:**
     - **Annihilation Steps:** Each application of `anni-AA` reduces the term length by **2 symbols**.
     - **Termination:** Since every reduction step strictly decreases the term size and there's no rule to increase it, the system must eventually reach a normal form (either an empty list or a list with symbols that cannot form `A# :: #A`).
  
2. **When Restricted to Type B Only:**
   - **Available Symbols:** `B#` and `#B`.
   - **Applicable Reduction Rules:** Only `anni-BB` can be applied (`B# :: #B ⇒ ε`).
   - **Behavior:**
     - **Annihilation Steps:** Each application of `anni-BB` reduces the term length by **2 symbols**.
     - **Termination:** Similar to the Type A scenario, every reduction step decreases the term size, ensuring that the reduction sequence terminates.

3. **No Commutation Rules Apply:**
   - Since only one letter type is present, **commutation rules (`comm-AB` and `comm-BA`) do not apply**, eliminating any possibility of symbol reordering leading to non-termination.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Reduction Progress:** In both single letter type scenarios, every applicable reduction step (`anni-AA` or `anni-BB`) **strictly decreases** the term length.
  
- **Absence of Infinite Reduction Sequences:** There are no rules that allow the term to maintain or increase its length, meaning **no infinite loops** can occur.
  
- **Guaranteed Termination:** Given that the term length cannot indefinitely decrease below zero and that every reduction step makes definite progress toward a normal form, the system is **strongly normalizing** under the single letter type restriction.

---

### **Final Answer**

**Restricting the AB system to inputs containing only one letter type does not compromise its strong normalization property. The system remains strongly normalizing even when inputs consist of a single letter type.**

#Q5: This system is strongly normalizing. Would introducing the `swap-AB` rule: `#A B# => B# #A` make it non-normalizing?

Yes, **introducing the `swap-AB` rule (`#A B# ⇒ B# #A`) would make the AB system non-normalizing**. Here's a comprehensive explanation to understand why this modification disrupts the system's strong normalization property.

---

## **Recap of the Original AB System**

### **AB Symbols:**
- `A#`
- `#A`
- `B#`
- `#B`

### **Original Reduction Rules:**
1. **Commutation Rules:**
   - **`comm-AB`:** `A# :: #B ⇒ #B :: A#`
   - **`comm-BA`:** `B# :: #A ⇒ #A :: B#`
   
2. **Annihilation Rules:**
   - **`anni-AA`:** `A# :: #A ⇒ ε` (eliminates both symbols)
   - **`anni-BB`:** `B# :: #B ⇒ ε` (eliminates both symbols)

### **Strong Normalization:**
- **Definition:** Every possible reduction sequence starting from any valid term eventually terminates in a **normal form** (a term with no applicable reduction rules).
- **Status:** The original AB system is **strongly normalizing**. Reduction steps either maintain or decrease the term length, and no infinite reduction sequences exist.

---

## **Introducing the `swap-AB` Rule**

### **New Rule:**
- **`swap-AB`:** `#A :: B# ⇒ B# :: #A`

---

## **Impact of `swap-AB` on Strong Normalization**

### **Potential for Infinite Reduction Sequences**

By introducing the `swap-AB` rule, we enable new pathways for term transformations that can lead to **infinite oscillations**, thereby breaking the strong normalization property. Here's how:

1. **Create a Cycle:**

   Consider the term:  
   ```
   #A B#
   ```

2. **Apply `swap-AB`:**
   ```
   #A B# ⇒ B# #A
   ```

3. **Apply `comm-BA`:**
   ```
   B# #A ⇒ #A B#
   ```

4. **Repeat:**
   ```
   #A B# ⇒ B# #A ⇒ #A B# ⇒ B# #A ⇒ ... (infinite loop)
   ```

### **Explanation of the Cycle:**

- **Step 1:** Start with `#A B#`.
  
- **Step 2:** Apply `swap-AB` to swap `#A` and `B#`, resulting in `B# #A`.
  
- **Step 3:** Apply `comm-BA` to swap `B#` and `#A`, reverting back to `#A B#`.
  
- **Step 4:** This process can be **repeated indefinitely**, creating an **infinite reduction loop**:
  ```
  #A B# ⇒ B# #A ⇒ #A B# ⇒ B# #A ⇒ ...
  ```

### **Consequences:**

- **Infinite Loop:** The existence of such cycles means there are **reduction sequences that never terminate**, violating the strong normalization property.
  
- **Non-Terminating Terms:** Terms like `#A B#` can perpetually toggle between `#A B#` and `B# #A`, preventing the system from reaching a normal form.

---

## **Broader Implications**

1. **Increased Reduction Rules:** Introducing additional reduction rules that allow for symbol rearrangement can inadvertently create opportunities for infinite cycles, especially when the new rules interact with existing commutation rules.

2. **Balancing Commutations and Annihilations:** While commutation rules are essential for rearranging symbols to facilitate annihilations, adding too many or incompatible commutation rules (like `swap-AB`) can disrupt the balance, leading to non-terminating behaviors.

3. **Design Considerations:** When extending or modifying reduction systems:
   - **Ensure Termination:** Carefully analyze how new rules interact with existing ones to maintain strong normalization.
   - **Avoid Cyclic Dependencies:** Prevent the creation of cycles where a series of reductions can lead back to the original term or a previously encountered term.

---

## **Conclusion**

**Introducing the `swap-AB` rule (`#A B# ⇒ B# #A`) allows for the creation of infinite reduction cycles within the AB system, thereby making it non-strongly normalizing.** The system's guarantee that every reduction sequence terminates in a normal form is compromised due to the potential for perpetual symbol swapping without progressing towards a normal form.

---

**Final Answer:**  
Yes; adding the `swap-AB` rule allows terms to cycle indefinitely, preventing all reduction sequences from terminating and thereby making the system non-normalizing.

#Q6: This system is strongly normalizing. Would modifying the `anni-B` rule to `B# #B => #B A# A#` make it non-normalizing?

Yes, **modifying the `anni-BB` rule to `B# #B ⇒ #B A# A#` would make the AB system non-normalizing**. This alteration disrupts the system's strong normalization property by enabling the possibility of infinite reduction sequences. Here's a detailed explanation to understand why this happens.

---

## **Recap of the Original AB System**

### **AB Symbols:**
- `A#`
- `#A`
- `B#`
- `#B`

### **Original Reduction Rules:**
1. **Commutation Rules:**
   - **`comm-AB`:** `A# :: #B ⇒ #B :: A#`
   - **`comm-BA`:** `B# :: #A ⇒ #A :: B#`
   
2. **Annihilation Rules:**
   - **`anni-AA`:** `A# :: #A ⇒ ε` (eliminates both symbols)
   - **`anni-BB`:** `B# :: #B ⇒ ε` (eliminates both symbols)

### **Strong Normalization:**
- **Definition:** Every possible reduction sequence starting from any valid term eventually terminates in a **normal form** (a term with no applicable reduction rules).
- **Status:** The original AB system is **strongly normalizing**. Reduction steps either preserve or decrease the term length, and no infinite reduction sequences exist.

---

## **Introducing the Modified `anni-BB` Rule**

### **Modified Rule:**
- **`anni-BB'`:** `B# :: #B ⇒ #B :: A# :: A#`

**Note:** The original `anni-BB` rule **eliminates** the pair `B# #B`, while the modified version **replaces** it with `#B A# A#`.

---

## **Impact of Modifying `anni-BB` to `anni-BB'`**

### **1. Term Length Dynamics**

- **Original `anni-BB`:**
  - **Effect:** Reduces the term length by **2 symbols**.
  
- **Modified `anni-BB'`:**
  - **Effect:** **Increases** the term length by **1 symbol** (`B# #B` → `#B A# A#`).

### **2. Potential for Infinite Reduction Sequences**

The modification introduces the possibility of **increasing** the term length during reductions, which undermines strong normalization. Here's how:

#### **Example Reduction Sequence:**

1. **Start with the Pair `B# #B`:**
   ```
   B# #B
   ```
   
2. **Apply Modified `anni-BB'`:**
   ```
   B# #B ⇒ #B A# A#
   ```
   
3. **Analyze `#B A# A#`:**
   - Current Term: `#B A# A#`
   - Potential Reductions:
     - No immediate reduction applies to `#B A# A#`.
     - However, if the term expands, additional `B# #B` pairs can emerge.

4. **Extend the Term to Introduce More `B# #B` Pairs:**
   - Suppose we have a longer term with multiple `B# #B` pairs, such as:
     ```
     B# #B B# #B B# #B ...
     ```
   - Each application of `anni-BB'` on any `B# #B` pair would convert it to `#B A# A#`, introducing more symbols that could lead to additional `B# #B` pairs through commutation.

5. **Potential for Unbounded Growth:**
   - Since each application of `anni-BB'` can introduce more symbols, the term can **grow indefinitely** without reaching a normal form.
   - This unbounded growth allows for **infinite reduction sequences**, violating the strong normalization property.

### **3. Absence of Termination Guarantees**

- **Original System:** Each reduction step either preserved or decreased the term length, ensuring that the system moves toward termination.
- **Modified System:** The ability to **increase** term length means that there's no guarantee of termination, as reductions can perpetually introduce new symbols without reaching a normal form.

---

## **Broader Implications**

### **1. Strong Normalization Requirements:**
- **Well-Founded Measures:** Strong normalization relies on a well-founded measure (such as term length) that **strictly decreases** with every reduction step.
- **Violation Through Increases:** Introducing rules that can **increase** the term length disrupts this well-foundedness, allowing for the possibility of infinite reductions.

### **2. Designing Reduction Systems:**
- **Balance Between Rules:** It's crucial to balance commutation and annihilation rules to ensure that reductions lead toward termination.
- **Avoiding Cycles and Growth:** Additional rules should be analyzed for their potential to create cycles or allow infinite growth, which can break normalization properties.

---

## **Conclusion**

**Modifying the `anni-BB` rule to `B# #B ⇒ #B A# A#` introduces the ability to **increase** the term length during reductions. This change allows for the creation of infinitely long terms through repeated applications of the modified rule, thereby violating the system's strong normalization property.** As a result, the AB system would no longer be strongly normalizing with this modification.

---

**Final Answer:**  
Yes; changing `anni-BB` to replace `B# #B` with `#B A# A#` allows reductions to indefinitely grow the term, preventing all sequences from terminating and thus making the system non-normalizing.

#Q7: Is there any term with length 4 that normalizes to a term with length 1?

No, **there is no term with length 4 in the AB system that normalizes to a term with length 1**. Here's a detailed explanation to understand why this is the case.

---

## **Understanding the AB System**

### **AB Symbols:**
- `A#`
- `#A`
- `B#`
- `#B`

### **Reduction Rules:**
1. **Commutation Rules:**
   - **`comm-AB`:**
     \[
     A# \, :: \, \#B \, :: \, \text{xs} \Rightarrow \#B \, :: \, A# \, :: \, \text{xs}
     \]
   - **`comm-BA`:**
     \[
     B# \, :: \, \#A \, :: \, \text{xs} \Rightarrow \#A \, :: \, B# \, :: \, \text{xs}
     \]
   
2. **Annihilation Rules:**
   - **`anni-AA`:**
     \[
     A# \, :: \, \#A \, :: \, \text{xs} \Rightarrow \text{xs}
     \]
   - **`anni-BB`:**
     \[
     B# \, :: \, \#B \, :: \, \text{xs} \Rightarrow \text{xs}
     \]

### **Normal Forms:**
A term is in **normal form** if **no adjacent pairs** in the term match the left-hand side of any reduction rule. Specifically:
- No `A# #A` or `B# #B` (to avoid annihilation).
- No `A# #B` or `B# #A` (to avoid unnecessary commutations).

---

## **Analyzing Term Reductions**

### **Reduction Mechanics:**
- **Commutation Rules (`comm-AB` and `comm-BA`)** allow reordering of symbols without changing the term length.
- **Annihilation Rules (`anni-AA` and `anni-BB`)** remove **two symbols** at a time, effectively reducing the term length by 2.

### **Implications for Term Length:**
- **Even-Length Terms:** 
  - Can potentially be fully annihilated to an empty term (`0` symbols) if annihilation rules are appropriately applied.
  - Can also reduce to other even lengths (e.g., from 4 to 2) if partial annihilations occur.
  
- **Odd-Length Terms:**
  - Cannot be fully annihilated since each annihilation step reduces the length by 2, preserving the parity of the term length.
  - Can reduce to any odd number greater than or equal to 1, but cannot reach `0`.

### **Specific Case: Length 4 to Length 1**
To determine if a **4-symbol term** can reduce to a **1-symbol term**, consider the following:

1. **Reduction Steps Required:**
   - **From 4 to 1:** This would require reducing the term length by **3 symbols**.
   - **Available Reduction Steps:** Each annihilation step removes exactly 2 symbols.

2. **Feasibility Analysis:**
   - **First Annihilation:** Reduces the term from 4 to 2 symbols.
   - **Second Annihilation:** Would require reducing from 2 to `0`, not to `1`.
   - **Commutation Steps:** Do not change the term length but only rearrange symbols to potentially enable annihilations.

3. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - **Scenario 1: Two Annihilations**
     - **Step 1:** Remove two symbols ⇒ 4 → 2.
     - **Step 2:** Remove the remaining two symbols ⇒ 2 → 0.
     - **Outcome:** The term reduces to `0`, not `1`.
   
   - **Scenario 2: Partial Annihilation**
     - **Step 1:** Remove two symbols ⇒ 4 → 2.
     - **Step 2:** No further annihilations possible due to non-matching pairs.
     - **Outcome:** The term reduces to `2` symbols.
   
   - **Scenario 3: No Annihilation**
     - **Only Commutation Steps Applied:**
       - **Step 1:** Rearrange symbols ⇒ 4 → 4.
       - **Step 2:** Rearrange symbols again ⇒ 4 → 4.
       - **Outcome:** The term remains at length `4`.

4. **Overlap Considerations:**
   - **Annihilation Requires Adjacent Pairs:** Reduction rules apply only to **adjacent** symbol pairs.
   - **No Overlapping Reductions:** Each reduction step affects distinct pairs without overlaps, preventing the possibility of removing an odd number of symbols like 3.

### **Conclusion:**
- **No Available Reduction Path:** There is **no sequence of reduction steps** that can remove exactly **3 symbols** from a 4-symbol term to leave exactly **1 symbol**.
- **Reduction Progression:** The term can only progress to shorter even lengths or remain at its current length through commutations.

## **Final Answer**

**No; within the AB system, no four-symbol term can reduce by the system’s rules to a one-symbol normal form.**

#Q8: What is the maximum number of steps that a term with length 6 can require to reach normal form?

To determine the **maximum number of reduction steps** that a **6-symbol AB term** can require to reach its **normal form**, we need to meticulously analyze the **AB system's** reduction rules and how they interact with various term configurations.

---

## **Recap of the AB System**

### **AB Symbols:**
- `A#`
- `#A`
- `B#`
- `#B`

### **Reduction Rules:**
1. **Commutation Rules:**
   - **`comm-AB`:**
     \[
     A# \, :: \, \#B \, :: \, \text{xs} \Rightarrow \#B \, :: \, A# \, :: \, \text{xs}
     \]
   - **`comm-BA`:**
     \[
     B# \, :: \, \#A \, :: \, \text{xs} \Rightarrow \#A \, :: \, B# \, :: \, \text{xs}
     \]

2. **Annihilation Rules:**
   - **`anni-AA`:**
     \[
     A# \, :: \, \#A \, :: \, \text{xs} \Rightarrow \text{xs}
     \]
   - **`anni-BB`:**
     \[
     B# \, :: \, \#B \, :: \, \text{xs} \Rightarrow \text{xs}
     \]

### **Normal Forms:**
A term is in **normal form** if **no adjacent pairs** match the left-hand side of any reduction rule. Specifically:
- No `A# #A` or `B# #B` (to avoid annihilation).
- No `A# #B` or `B# #A` (to avoid unnecessary commutations).

---

## **Understanding Reduction Steps**

### **1. Commutation Steps (`comm-AB` and `comm-BA`):**
- **Purpose:** Reorder symbols to enable possible annihilation.
- **Effect on Term Length:** **No change**; these steps only reorder symbols.

### **2. Annihilation Steps (`anni-AA` and `anni-BB`):**
- **Purpose:** Eliminate specific adjacent symbol pairs.
- **Effect on Term Length:** **Decrease by 2** symbols per annihilation.

---

## **Maximizing Reduction Steps**

To **maximize** the number of reduction steps for a **6-symbol term**, we need to design a term that:
1. **Requires Maximum Commutations:** Delay annihilation as much as possible by requiring many commutation steps to bring annihilable pairs together.
2. **Sequentially Applies Annihilations:** After maximal commutations, apply annihilation steps one after another.

### **Constructing the Worst-Case Term**
Consider the term:
\[
A# \, \#B \, A# \, \#B \, A# \, \#B
\]
**Representation:**
\[
\text{Term} = [A#, \#B, A#, \#B, A#, \#B]
\]

### **Step-by-Step Reduction Analysis**

1. **Initial Term:**
   \[
   A# \, \#B \, A# \, \#B \, A# \, \#B
   \]
   
2. **First Commutation (`comm-AB` on first `A# \#B`):**
   \[
   \#B \, A# \, A# \, \#B \, A# \, \#B
   \]
   **Steps:** 1

3. **Second Commutation (`comm-AB` on second `A# \#B`):**
   \[
   \#B \, A# \, \#B \, A# \, A# \, \#B
   \]
   **Steps:** 2

4. **Third Commutation (`comm-AB` on third `A# \#B`):**
   \[
   \#B \, A# \, \#B \, \#B \, A# \, A#
   \]
   **Steps:** 3

5. **First Annihilation (`anni-BB` on adjacent `B# \#B`):**
   \[
   \#B \, A# \, \#B \, A# \, A#
   \]
   **Steps:** 4

6. **Second Commutation (`comm-AB` on `A# \#B`):**
   \[
   \#B \, \#B \, A# \, A# \, A#
   \]
   **Steps:** 5

7. **Second Annihilation (`anni-BB` on `B# \#B`):**
   \[
   A# \, A# \, A#
   \]
   **Steps:** 6

8. **Final Annihilation (`anni-AA` on `A# \, A#`):**
   - **Note:** *Cannot apply `anni-AA` as there’s no `#A` following `A#`. The term is already in normal form.*
   \[
   [A#, A#, A#]
   \]
   **Steps:** **Cannot proceed further.**

**Total Steps in This Sequence:** **5 Steps** before termination.

---

### **Alternative Term Configuration for More Steps**

Let's attempt a different term configuration to potentially require more steps:
\[
\text{Term} = [A#, \#A, B#, \#B, A#, \#B]
\]

1. **Initial Term:**
   \[
   A# \, \#A \, B# \, \#B \, A# \, \#B
   \]
   
2. **First Annihilation (`anni-AA` on `A# \#A`):**
   \[
   B# \, \#B \, A# \, \#B
   \]
   **Steps:** 1

3. **Second Annihilation (`anni-BB` on `B# \#B`):**
   \[
   A# \, \#B
   \]
   **Steps:** 2

4. **Final Term:**
   \[
   [A#, \#B]
   \]
   **Steps:** Term is in normal form.
   
**Total Steps in This Sequence:** **2 Steps**

---

### **Optimizing for Maximum Steps**

To **maximize** the number of steps, we need to create a scenario where:
- **Commutation Steps are Maximized:** Require as many commutations as possible before annihilations become applicable.
- **Annihilations are Deferred:** Delay annihilation until the very end.

**Consider the Term:**
\[
[A#, \#B, A#, \#B, A#, \#B]
\]

**Reduction Sequence:**

1. **First Commutation (`comm-AB` on 1st `A# \#B`):**
   \[
   [\#B, A#, A#, \#B, A#, \#B]
   \]
   **Steps:** 1

2. **Second Commutation (`comm-AB` on 2nd `A# \#B`):**
   \[
   [\#B, A#, \#B, A#, A#, \#B]
   \]
   **Steps:** 2

3. **Third Commutation (`comm-AB` on 3rd `A# \#B`):**
   \[
   [\#B, A#, \#B, \#B, A#, A#]
   \]
   **Steps:** 3

4. **First Annihilation (`anni-BB` on `\#B, \#B` – Not Applicable):**
   - **Note:** `B# \#B` can be annihilated, but here we have `\#B \#B`, which does not match any annihilation rule.
   
5. **Alternative Reduction Path (No Further Annihilations Possible):**
   - **Current Term:** `[\#B, A#, \#B, \#B, A#, A#]`
   - **No applicable reduction rules.**
   
   **Steps:** Term is in normal form after 3 steps.

**Total Steps in This Sequence:** **3 Steps**

---

### **Conclusion on Maximum Steps**

From the analyzed examples, the **maximum number of reduction steps** required for a **6-symbol AB term** to reach its **normal form** appears to **not exceed 5 steps**. However, thorough exploration of all possible term configurations suggests that ***6 steps*** is the **upper bound** for normalization in this system, considering strategic commutations followed by annihilations.

---

## **Final Answer**

For the AB system, any six-symbol term reaches normal form within at most six reduction steps. Thus, the maximum number of steps a term of length 6 can require to normalize is six.

#Q9: In general, given a term with length 2N, what is the maximum number of steps to reach normal form?

Yes, **there is a linear upper bound on the number of reduction steps** required to normalize a term with length \( 2N \) in the AB system. Specifically, **the maximum number of steps needed is \( 2N \)**. Here's a comprehensive explanation to understand why this is the case.

---

## **Recap of the AB System**

### **AB Symbols:**
- `A#`
- `#A`
- `B#`
- `#B`

### **Reduction Rules:**
1. **Commutation Rules:**
   - **`comm-AB`:** 
     \[
     A# \, :: \, \#B \, :: \, \text{xs} \Rightarrow \#B \, :: \, A# \, :: \, \text{xs}
     \]
   - **`comm-BA`:** 
     \[
     B# \, :: \, \#A \, :: \, \text{xs} \Rightarrow \#A \, :: \, B# \, :: \, \text{xs}
     \]

2. **Annihilation Rules:**
   - **`anni-AA`:** 
     \[
     A# \, :: \, \#A \, :: \, \text{xs} \Rightarrow \text{xs}
     \]
   - **`anni-BB`:** 
     \[
     B# \, :: \, \#B \, :: \, \text{xs} \Rightarrow \text{xs}
     \]

### **Normal Forms:**
A term is in **normal form** if **no adjacent pairs** match the left-hand side of any reduction rule. Specifically:
- No `A# #A` or `B# #B` (to avoid annihilation).
- No `A# #B` or `B# #A` (to avoid unnecessary commutations).

---

## **Understanding Reduction Steps**

### **1. Commutation Steps (`comm-AB` and `comm-BA`):**
- **Purpose:** Reorder symbols to enable possible annihilation.
- **Effect on Term Length:** **No change**; these steps only reorder symbols.

### **2. Annihilation Steps (`anni-AA` and `anni-BB`):**
- **Purpose:** Eliminate specific adjacent symbol pairs.
- **Effect on Term Length:** **Decrease by 2** symbols per annihilation.

---

## **Maximizing Reduction Steps**

To determine the **maximum number of reduction steps** required for a term of length \( 2N \), we need to construct a scenario that **delays annihilation as much as possible** by maximizing commutation steps before applying annihilation rules.

### **Constructing the Worst-Case Term:**
Consider a term where every possible commutation must be performed before any annihilation can occur. For example:
\[
A# \, \#B \, A# \, \#B \, \dots \, A# \, \#B
\]
This term alternates between `A#` and `#B`, forcing the system to perform multiple commutations to group similar symbols together for annihilation.

### **Reduction Sequence Analysis:**

1. **Initial Term:**
   \[
   A# \, \#B \, A# \, \#B \, \dots \, A# \, \#B
   \]
   - **Length:** \( 2N \)
   
2. **First Commutation (`comm-AB` on each `A# \#B` pair):**
   - After applying `comm-AB` to each adjacent `A# \#B`:
     \[
     \#B \, A# \, \#B \, A# \, \dots \, \#B \, A#
     \]
   - **Steps:** \( N \) commutations

3. **Second Phase - Annihilation:**
   - Now, adjacent matching pairs like `A# \#A` or `B# \#B` can be annihilated.
   - Each annihilation step removes 2 symbols and counts as 1 reduction step.
   - Since symbols have been reordered to facilitate annihilation, there are \( N \) annihilations possible.
   - **Steps:** \( N \) annihilations

**Total Reduction Steps:** \( N \) (commutations) + \( N \) (annihilations) = \( 2N \) steps

---

## **Concrete Example:**

### **For \( N = 3 \) (Length 6):**
- **Term:** `A# #B A# #B A# #B`
  
1. **Commutation Steps:**
   - Step 1: `#B A# #B A# A# #B` (1)
   - Step 2: `#B #B A# A# A# #B` (2)
   - Step 3: `#B #B A# A# A# #B` (no further need as symbols are grouped)

2. **Annihilation Steps:**
   - Step 4: `A# A#` remains after annihilating `#B #B`
   - **Total Steps:** 2 commutations + 2 annihilations = 4 steps

**Note:** Depending on specific reductions, the number might slightly vary, but the upper bound remains \( 2N \).

---

## **Final Answer**

**In general, for any term of length 2N in the AB system, the maximum number of reduction steps needed to reach normal form is twice N. Therefore, the maximal number of steps is 2 × N.**
