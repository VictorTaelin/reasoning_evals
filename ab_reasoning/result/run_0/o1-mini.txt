Let an AB symbol be one of 4 possible variants:

  data AB : Set where
    A# : AB
    #A : AB
    B# : AB
    #B : AB

Let an AB Term be a list of AB symbols:

  Term : Set = List AB

An AB system computes via the following step reduction relation:

  data _=>_ : List AB → List AB → Set where
    comm-AB : ∀ xs → (A# ∷ #B ∷ xs) => (#B ∷ A# ∷ xs)
    comm-BA : ∀ xs → (B# ∷ #A ∷ xs) => (#A ∷ B# ∷ xs)
    anni-AA : ∀ xs → (A# ∷ #A ∷ xs) => xs
    anni-BB : ∀ xs → (B# ∷ #B ∷ xs) => xs

An AB term is in normal form if it can't be reduced further.

For example, the normal form of the term below can be computed in 3 steps:

  B# A# #B #A B#
  -------------- comm-AB
  B# #B A# #А B#
  -------------- anni-BB
  A# #А B#
  -------- anni-AA
  B#

Note that a pair only interacts when the '#' is internal.
For example, 'A# #A' interacts, but '#A A#' does not.

Your goal is to answer logical questions about this system. Can we start?

Absolutely, I'm ready to help you explore and answer logical questions about the AB system you've described. Whether you want to delve deeper into its properties, prove certain behaviors, or analyze specific terms and their normal forms, feel free to ask your questions!

#Q0: What's the normal form of `#A A# #B A# A# B# B# #A #B B# #A B# #B`?

Let's compute the **normal form** of the AB term:

```
#A A# #B A# A# B# B# #A #B B# #A B# #B
```

### Step-by-Step Reduction:

1. **Initial Term:**
   ```
   [#A, A#, #B, A#, A#, B#, B#, #A, #B, B#, #A, B#, #B]
   ```

2. **Step 1:** Apply `comm-AB` to `A# #B`:
   ```
   [#A, #B, A#, A#, B#, B#, #A, #B, B#, #A, B#, #B]
   ```

3. **Step 2:** Apply `comm-BA` to `B# #A`:
   ```
   [#A, #B, A#, A#, #A, B#, #B, B#, #A, B#, #B]
   ```

4. **Step 3:** Apply `anni-AA` to `A# #A`:
   ```
   [#A, #B, A#, B#, #B, B#, #A, B#, #B]
   ```

5. **Step 4:** Apply `anni-BB` to `B# #B`:
   ```
   [#A, #B, B#, #B]
   ```

6. **Step 5:** Apply `anni-BB` to another `B# #B`:
   ```
   [#A, #B]
   ```

7. **Final Normal Form:**
   ```
   [#A, #B]
   ```

### Conclusion:

The **normal form** of the term `#A A# #B A# A# B# B# #A #B B# #A B# #B` is:

```
#A #B
```

This term cannot be reduced further using the defined reduction rules.

#Q1: Is the AB system strongly normalizing?

Yes, the **AB system is strongly normalizing**. Here's a detailed explanation to support this conclusion.

### **Understanding Strong Normalization**

**Strong normalization** means that every possible sequence of reduction steps will eventually terminate in a normal form (a term that cannot be reduced further). In other words, there are no infinite reduction sequences possible within the system.

### **Analyzing the AB System**

Let's break down the components of the AB system to understand why it is strongly normalizing:

1. **Components of the System:**
   - **AB Symbols:** `A#`, `#A`, `B#`, `#B`
   - **Terms:** Lists of AB symbols.
   - **Reduction Rules:**
     - **Commutation Rules:**
       - `comm-AB`: `A# #B → #B A#`
       - `comm-BA`: `B# #A → #A B#`
     - **Annihilation Rules:**
       - `anni-AA`: `A# #A → ε` (removes the pair)
       - `anni-BB`: `B# #B → ε` (removes the pair)

2. **Properties of Reduction Rules:**
   - **Commutation Rules:** These rules reorder symbols without changing the overall length of the term.
   - **Annihilation Rules:** These rules reduce the length of the term by removing specific adjacent pairs.

3. **Behavior of Reduction Steps:**
   - **Reducing or Maintaining Length:** Each reduction step either leaves the length of the term unchanged (through commutation) or decreases it (through annihilation).
   - **Finite Length:** Since terms are finite lists of symbols, the number of possible configurations is also finite.

### **Ensuring Strong Normalization**

1. **No Infinite Reduction Sequences:**
   - **Reduction Choices are Limited:** Given a finite term, the number of ways to apply commutation rules is also finite. You cannot indefinitely shuffle symbols without eventually reaching a state where no further commutations are possible.
   - **Annihilation Progresses Reduction:** Annihilation rules incontrovertibly reduce the size of the term, ensuring that repeated application of these rules will eventually terminate the reduction process.

2. **Bounding the Reduction Steps:**
   - **Length Decreases Over Time:** Since annihilation reduces the length and commutation doesn’t increase it, the system is bounded in terms of the number of symbols.
   - **Finite Permutations:** With a finite number of symbols, there is a finite number of possible permutations and thus a finite number of possible reduction steps before reaching a normal form.

3. **Confluence and Termination:**
   - **Confluence Not Required but Supports Termination:** While strong normalization doesn't inherently require confluence (unique normal forms regardless of the reduction path), the finite and reducing nature of the system inherently supports termination.

### **Conclusion**

Given that every reduction step either maintains or reduces the length of the term and that all terms are finite, **every reduction sequence must eventually terminate**. There are no infinite loops because:

- **Annihilation steps reduce the term's length.**
- **Commutation steps, while they reorder symbols, cannot be applied infinitely due to the finite number of permutations possible in a finite-length term.**

Thus, **the AB system is strongly normalizing**.

### **Summary**

- **Strong Normalization:** Every reduction sequence terminates.
- **AB System Analysis:** Finite terms with reduction steps that either maintain or decrease term length.
- **Conclusion:** No infinite reduction sequences are possible; hence, the system is strongly normalizing.

**Final Answer:**  
Yes. In every case, all reduction sequences terminate, so the AB system is strongly normalizing.

#Q2: In a normalized term starting with `#A B#`, which symbols can occur afterwards?

To determine which symbols can occur after `#A B#` in a **normalized** AB term, we need to analyze the reduction rules and understand the constraints they impose on the term's structure.

### **Recap of the AB System**

- **AB Symbols:** `A#`, `#A`, `B#`, `#B`
- **Terms:** Lists of AB symbols.
- **Reduction Rules:**
  1. **Commutation Rules:**
     - `comm-AB`: `A# #B → #B A#`
     - `comm-BA`: `B# #A → #A B#`
  2. **Annihilation Rules:**
     - `anni-AA`: `A# #A → ε` (removes the pair)
     - `anni-BB`: `B# #B → ε` (removes the pair)

### **Understanding Normal Forms**

A term is in **normal form** if **no further reductions** can be applied. This means:

- **No Adjacent Pairs:** The term cannot contain any of the following adjacent pairs:
  - `A# #B` (can be commuted)
  - `B# #A` (can be commuted)
  - `A# #A` (can be annihilated)
  - `B# #B` (can be annihilated)

### **Analyzing the Term Starting with `#A B#`**

Given a normalized term that **starts with `#A B#`**, we examine what can **immediately follow** `B#` to ensure the term remains in normal form.

1. **Current Prefix:** `[ #A, B#, ... ]`

2. **Constraints After `B#`:**
   - **Prevent Reducible Pairs:**
     - The symbol following `B#` (**let's denote it as `x`**) **cannot** be:
       - `#A` (since `B# #A` → `#A B#`)
       - `#B` (since `B# #B` → ε)
   - **Allowed Symbols for `x`:**
     - `A#`
     - `B#`

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **If `x` is `A#`:**
     - The pair `[B#, A#]` **does not** match any left-hand side of the reduction rules.
     - Therefore, `[B#, A#]` is **allowed** in normal forms.
   - **If `x` is `B#`:**
     - The pair `[B#, B#]` **does not** directly match any reduction rule.
     - Therefore, `[B#, B#]` is **allowed** in normal forms.

4. **Extending Beyond Immediate Symbols:**
   - After ensuring that the **immediate symbol** after `B#` is either `A#` or `B#`, the **rest of the term** must also adhere to the same normalization constraints.
   - For example:
     - If the term is `[ #A, B#, A#, ... ]`, the next symbol after `A#` must not violate the normalization rules.
     - Similarly, if the term is `[ #A, B#, B#, ... ]`, the continuation must continue to respect the normalization constraints.

### **Conclusion**

In a **normalized** AB term that **starts with `#A B#`**, the symbols that can **immediately follow** `B#` are:

- `A#`
- `B#`

These choices ensure that **no reduction rules** apply to the adjacent pairs, maintaining the term's normal form.

---

**Final Answer:**  
After `#A B#` in a normal form, only `A#` or `B#` may follow.

#Q3: In a normalized term starting with `A#`, which symbols can NOT occur afterwards?

In a **normalized** AB term that **starts with `A#`**, certain symbols cannot follow `A#` to maintain the term's normal form. Let's analyze which symbols are **prohibited** from occurring immediately after `A#`.

### **Recap of the AB System**

- **AB Symbols:** `A#`, `#A`, `B#`, `#B`
- **Reduction Rules:**
  1. **Commutation Rules:**
     - `comm-AB`: `A# #B → #B A#`
     - `comm-BA`: `B# #A → #A B#`
  2. **Annihilation Rules:**
     - `anni-AA`: `A# #A → ε` (removes the pair)
     - `anni-BB`: `B# #B → ε` (removes the pair)

### **Understanding Normal Forms**

A term is in **normal form** if **no further reductions** can be applied. This means:

- **No Adjacent Reducible Pairs:** The term cannot contain any of the following adjacent pairs:
  - `A# #B` (can be commuted)
  - `B# #A` (can be commuted)
  - `A# #A` (can be annihilated)
  - `B# #B` (can be annihilated)

### **Analyzing the Prefix `A#` in Normal Form**

Given a normalized term that **starts with `A#`**, we need to determine which symbols **cannot** immediately follow `A#` to prevent any possible reductions.

1. **Current Prefix:** `[ A#, x, ... ]`

2. **Possible Symbols for `x`:**
   - `A#`
   - `#A`
   - `B#`
   - `#B`

3. **Evaluating Each Possibility:**

   - **Case 1: `x = A#`**
     - **Pair:** `A# A#`
     - **Reduction:** No reduction rules apply.
     - **Status:** Allowed in normal form.

   - **Case 2: `x = #A`**
     - **Pair:** `A# #A`
     - **Reduction:** Matches `anni-AA` (`A# #A → ε`).
     - **Status:** **Not allowed** in normal form (would be reduced).

   - **Case 3: `x = B#`**
     - **Pair:** `A# B#`
     - **Reduction:** No direct reduction rules apply.
     - **Status:** Allowed in normal form.

   - **Case 4: `x = #B`**
     - **Pair:** `A# #B`
     - **Reduction:** Matches `comm-AB` (`A# #B → #B A#`).
     - **Status:** **Not allowed** in normal form (would be commuted).

### **Conclusion**

In a **normalized** AB term that **starts with `A#`**, the symbols that **cannot** immediately follow `A#` are:

- `#A`
- `#B`

These symbols would trigger reduction rules (`anni-AA` and `comm-AB`, respectively), violating the term's normal form.

### **Final Answer**

After an initial `A#` in a normal form, the symbols `#A` and `#B` cannot follow.

#Q4: This system is strongly normalizing. Would allowing only inputs with a single letter type make it non-normalizing?

No, **restricting the AB system to only allow inputs with a single letter type does not make it non-normalizing**. In fact, the system remains **strongly normalizing** under this restriction. Here's a detailed explanation:

### **Understanding the Original AB System**

1. **Symbols and Terms:**
   - **AB Symbols:** `A#`, `#A`, `B#`, `#B`
   - **Terms:** Lists (sequences) of AB symbols.

2. **Reduction Rules:**
   - **Commutation Rules:**
     - `comm-AB`: `A# #B → #B A#`
     - `comm-BA`: `B# #A → #A B#`
   - **Annihilation Rules:**
     - `anni-AA`: `A# #A → ε` (removes the pair)
     - `anni-BB`: `B# #B → ε` (removes the pair)

3. **Strong Normalization:**
   - **Definition:** A system is **strongly normalizing** if **every possible reduction sequence terminates** in a normal form (a term with no further reductions).
   - **Original System:** As previously established, the AB system is strongly normalizing because each reduction step either decreases the term's length or reorders symbols without introducing new reducible pairs indefinitely.

### **Restricting to a Single Letter Type**

**Scenario:** Allowing only a single letter type (e.g., only `A` symbols: `A#` and `#A`), effectively removing all `B` symbols (`B#` and `#B`) from the system.

1. **Modified Symbols and Terms:**
   - **AB Symbols:** `A#`, `#A` (since `B` symbols are excluded)
   - **Terms:** Lists of `A#` and `#A` symbols.

2. **Modified Reduction Rules:**
   - **Annihilation Rules Only:**
     - `anni-AA`: `A# #A → ε`
   - **Commutation Rules:**
     - **No applicable**, as they involve `B` symbols which are no longer present.

3. **Analyzing Strong Normalization in the Restricted System:**
   - **Available Reduction Rule:** Only `anni-AA` can be applied, which **strictly reduces the term's length** by removing adjacent `A# #A` pairs.
   - **Behavior of Reductions:**
     - **Finite Reductions:** Each application of `anni-AA` reduces the term length by two symbols.
     - **Termination Guarantee:** Since each reduction step decreases the term size and the system starts with a finite number of symbols, **all reduction sequences must terminate**.
   - **Absence of Infinite Reduction Sequences:**
     - There are **no commutation rules** to reorder symbols and potentially create new reducible pairs.
     - The **only action** is the elimination of `A# #A` pairs, which cannot be reversed or lead to further reductions once all such pairs are removed.

4. **Conclusion for the Restricted System:**
   - **Strong Normalization Preserved:** The restricted system ensures that every reduction sequence leads to a term with fewer symbols, ultimately reaching a normal form where no `A# #A` pairs remain.
   - **No Possibility of Non-Terminating Reductions:** Without the commutation rules and with only annihilation rules that reduce term length, there is no mechanism to create cycles or infinite reduction paths.

### **Final Answer**

**No. Limiting the system to a single letter type still ensures all reductions terminate, so it remains strongly normalizing.**

#Q5: This system is strongly normalizing. Would introducing the `swap-AB` rule: `#A B# => B# #A` make it non-normalizing?

Yes, **introducing the `swap-AB` rule (`#A B# ⇒ B# #A`) would make the AB system non-strongly normalizing**. Here's a detailed explanation of why this occurs.

---

### **Recap of the Original AB System**

1. **AB Symbols:**
   - `A#`
   - `#A`
   - `B#`
   - `#B`

2. **Reduction Rules:**
   - **Commutation Rules:**
     - `comm-AB`: `A# #B ⇒ #B A#`
     - `comm-BA`: `B# #A ⇒ #A B#`
   - **Annihilation Rules:**
     - `anni-AA`: `A# #A ⇒ ε` (removes the pair)
     - `anni-BB`: `B# #B ⇒ ε` (removes the pair)

3. **Strong Normalization:**
   - The system is **strongly normalizing** because every reduction either **decreases the term's length** (via annihilation) or **reorders symbols in a finite manner** (via commutation), ensuring that all reduction sequences terminate in a normal form.

---

### **Introducing the `swap-AB` Rule**

**New Reduction Rule:**
- `swap-AB`: `#A B# ⇒ B# #A`

**Modified Set of Reduction Rules:**
1. `comm-AB`: `A# #B ⇒ #B A#`
2. `comm-BA`: `B# #A ⇒ #A B#`
3. `anni-AA`: `A# #A ⇒ ε`
4. `anni-BB`: `B# #B ⇒ ε`
5. `swap-AB`: `#A B# ⇒ B# #A`

---

### **Analyzing the Impact of `swap-AB`**

**Potential for Infinite Reduction Sequences:**
- Consider the **pair** `#A B#`:
  1. **Apply `swap-AB`:**
     ```
     #A B# ⇒ B# #A
     ```
  2. **Apply `comm-BA`:**
     ```
     B# #A ⇒ #A B#
     ```
  3. **Repeat:**
     ```
     #A B# ⇒ B# #A ⇒ #A B# ⇒ B# #A ⇒ ... (infinite loop)
     ```

**Implications:**
- **Cycle Creation:** The combination of `swap-AB` and `comm-BA` creates a **cycle** between `#A B#` and `B# #A`. This cycle can be **repeated indefinitely**, leading to an **infinite reduction sequence**.
  
- **Non-Termination:** Since it's possible to **cycle between two states indefinitely**, the system **no longer guarantees termination** for all possible reduction sequences.

---

### **Conclusion**

By introducing the `swap-AB` rule, the AB system gains a mechanism to **cycle between `#A B#` and `B# #A` infinitely**. This **breaks the strong normalization property**, as there now exist **infinite reduction paths** where the system **never reaches a normal form**.

---

### **Final Answer**

**Yes. Adding the `swap-AB` rule creates reduction cycles, allowing infinite reductions and thus making the system not strongly normalizing.**

#Q6: This system is strongly normalizing. Would modifying the `anni-B` rule to `B# #B => #B A# A#` make it non-normalizing?

No, **modifying the `anni-BB` rule to `B# #B ⇒ #B A# A#` does not make the AB system non-strongly normalizing**. In fact, the system **remains strongly normalizing** even with this modification. Here's a detailed explanation to clarify why this is the case.

---

### **Recap of the Original AB System**

1. **AB Symbols:**
   - `A#`
   - `#A`
   - `B#`
   - `#B`

2. **Original Reduction Rules:**
   - **Commutation Rules:**
     - `comm-AB`: `A# #B ⇒ #B A#`
     - `comm-BA`: `B# #A ⇒ #A B#`
   - **Annihilation Rules:**
     - `anni-AA`: `A# #A ⇒ ε` (removes the pair)
     - `anni-BB`: `B# #B ⇒ ε` (removes the pair)

3. **Strong Normalization:**
   - **Definition:** A system is **strongly normalizing** if **every possible reduction sequence terminates** in a normal form (a term with no further reductions).
   - **Original System:** The AB system is strongly normalizing because each reduction either decreases the term's length (through annihilation) or reorders symbols in a finite manner (through commutation), ensuring termination.

---

### **Modification Introduced in Q6**

**New Reduction Rule:**
- `anni-BB`: Changed from `B# #B ⇒ ε` to `B# #B ⇒ #B A# A#`

**Modified Set of Reduction Rules:**
1. `comm-AB`: `A# #B ⇒ #B A#`
2. `comm-BA`: `B# #A ⇒ #A B#`
3. `anni-AA`: `A# #A ⇒ ε`
4. `anni-BB`: `B# #B ⇒ #B A# A#`

---

### **Analyzing the Impact of the Modification**

1. **Understanding the Modified Reduction:**
   - The modified `anni-BB` rule replaces the pair `B# #B` with `#B A# A#` instead of removing it.
   - **Effect:** This transformation **replaces two symbols with three**, potentially increasing the term's length.

2. **Potential for Infinite Reductions:**
   - **Initial Observation:** At first glance, replacing `B# #B` with `#B A# A#` might seem to allow for an increase in term length, hinting at the possibility of infinite reductions.
   - **Key Insight:** However, the ability to infinitely reduce depends on whether the modified rule can be applied repeatedly without bound.

3. **Detailed Reduction Analysis:**
   
   - **Case 1: Single Pair Reduction**
     - **Starting Term:** `B# #B`
     - **After Reduction:** `#B A# A#`
     - **Further Reductions:** No `B# #B` pairs remain in `#B A# A#`, so no further `anni-BB` reductions are possible.
     - **Termination:** Reduction sequence terminates.
   
   - **Case 2: Multiple Pairs**
     - **Starting Term:** `B# #B B# #B`
     - **Step 1:** Replace the first `B# #B` with `#B A# A#` ⇒ `#B A# A# B# #B`
     - **Step 2:** Replace the next `B# #B` in `#B A# A# B# #B` with `#B A# A#` ⇒ `#B A# A# #B A# A#`
     - **Further Reductions:** No `B# #B` pairs remain in `#B A# A# #B A# A#`, so reductions terminate.
   
   - **General Observation:**
     - Each application of the modified `anni-BB` rule **eliminates one `B# #B` pair** and replaces it with symbols that **do not form new `B# #B` pairs**.
     - **Result:** The number of `B# #B` pairs in the term **decreases with each reduction step**.

4. **Formal Measure for Strong Normalization:**
   
   - **Define a Measure:** Let \( M(T) \) be the number of `B# #B` pairs in a term \( T \).
   - **Reduction Effect:** Each application of `anni-BB` reduces \( M(T) \) by 1.
   - **Termination Guarantee:** Since \( M(T) \) is a **non-negative integer** and **decreases with each reduction**, the reduction process **must terminate** when \( M(T) = 0 \).
   - **Absence of Cycles:** No combination of other reduction rules can **reintroduce `B# #B` pairs**, ensuring that the measure \( M(T) \) cannot increase or cycle.

5. **Conclusion from Analysis:**
   
   - **No Infinite Reduction Sequences:** Due to the decreasing measure \( M(T) \), there are **no infinite reduction paths**.
   - **Termination Achieved:** Every reduction sequence will eventually reach a normal form where no `B# #B` pairs remain, and no further reductions are possible.

---

### **Final Answer**

**No. Changing the `anni-BB` rule to `B# #B ⇒ #B A# A#` does not introduce infinite reductions. The system remains strongly normalizing because each application of the modified rule reduces the number of `B# #B` pairs, ensuring that all reduction sequences eventually terminate.**

#Q7: Is there any term with length 4 that normalizes to a term with length 1?

No, there is **no AB term of length 4** that normalizes to a term of **length 1**. Here's a comprehensive explanation to support this conclusion.

---

## **Understanding the AB System**

### **AB Symbols and Terms**
- **AB Symbols:** The system comprises four symbols:
  - `A#`
  - `#A`
  - `B#`
  - `#B`
  
- **Terms:** A term is a list of these AB symbols. The **length** of a term corresponds to the number of symbols it contains. For example, the term `A# #B B# #A` has a length of 4.

### **Reduction Rules**
The AB system defines the following **step reduction** rules:

1. **Commutation Rules:**
   - `comm-AB`: `A# #B → #B A#`
   - `comm-BA`: `B# #A → #A B#`

2. **Annihilation Rules:**
   - `anni-AA`: `A# #A → ε` (removes the pair)
   - `anni-BB`: `B# #B → ε` (removes the pair)

### **Normal Forms**
- A term is in **normal form** if **no further reductions** can be applied.
- **Reduction Steps:**
  - **Commutation Rules** allow reordering of symbols without changing the term's length.
  - **Annihilation Rules** remove **two symbols** at a time, thus **decreasing** the term's length by 2.

---

## **Analyzing Term Reduction to Length 1**

### **Initial Considerations**
- **Reduction Impact:**
  - **Commutation Rules** do **not** alter the term's length.
  - **Annihilation Rules** always **remove two symbols**, decreasing the term's length by 2.

- **Parity Preservation:**
  - Starting with an **even-length** term (e.g., length 4), applying **any number of annihilation steps** will always result in an **even-length** term (e.g., 4 → 2 → 0).
  - Conversely, starting with an **odd-length** term can reduce to an **odd-length** normal form (e.g., length 5 can reduce to 1).

### **Attempting to Reduce a 4-Symbol Term to Length 1**
Let's explore whether a 4-symbol term can reduce to a 1-symbol term:

1. **Example Term:** `A# #B B# #A`
   
   **Reduction Steps:**
   - **Apply `comm-AB`:** `A# #B → #B A#`
     - Resulting Term: `#B A# B# #A`
   
   - **Apply `comm-BA`:** `B# #A → #A B#`
     - Resulting Term: `#B #A B#`

   - **Attempt Further Reductions:**
     - **Check for Reducible Pairs:**
       - `#B #A` and `B#` are present.
       - No applicable annihilation or commutation rules reduce this to a single symbol.

   - **Final Term:** `#B #A B#` (Length 3)

   - **Conclusion:** Although the term started with length 4 and reduced to length 3, it did not achieve a reduction to length 1.

2. **Another Example Term:** `B# A# #B #A`
   
   **Reduction Steps:**
   - **Apply `comm-AB`:** `A# #B → #B A#`
     - Resulting Term: `B# #B A# #A`
   
   - **Apply `anni-BB`:** `B# #B → ε`
     - Resulting Term: `A# #A`
   
   - **Apply `anni-AA`:** `A# #A → ε`
     - Resulting Term: `ε` (Length 0)
   
   - **Conclusion:** This term reduces to length 0, not length 1.

### **General Observation**
- **Reduction Steps Impacting Length:**
  - Each **annihilation** always **removes two symbols**.
  - **Commutation** does **not** change the term's length.
  
- **Implication on Parity:**
  - Starting with an **even-length** term (like length 4), you can only reduce it to **even or zero lengths** (e.g., 4 → 2 → 0).
  - **It's impossible** to reach an **odd-length** term (like length 1) from an **even-length** starting point using the defined reduction rules.

- **No Mechanism to Remove an Odd Number of Symbols:**
  - There are **no reduction rules** that remove an **odd number** of symbols (e.g., removing one symbol) to achieve a term of length 1 from length 4.

---

## **Conclusion**

Given the **parity preservation** enforced by the reduction rules—where **even-length** terms can only reduce to **even or zero lengths**—there exists **no term of length 4** in the AB system that can normalize to a term of **length 1**.

### **Final Answer:**

**No. In the AB system, no four-symbol term can reduce to a single-symbol normal form.**

#Q8: What is the maximum number of steps that a term with length 6 can require to reach normal form?



#Q9: In general, given a term with length 2N, what is the maximum number of steps to reach normal form?

To determine the **maximum number of reduction steps** required for a term of length \( 2N \) in the **AB system** to reach its **normal form**, we'll perform a detailed analysis of the system's behavior and its reduction rules.

## **Recap of the AB System**

### **Symbols and Terms**
- **AB Symbols:**
  - `A#`
  - `#A`
  - `B#`
  - `#B`
  
- **Terms:**
  - A term is a **list** of these AB symbols.
  - The **length** of a term corresponds to the number of symbols it contains. For example, the term `A# B# #A #B` has a length of 4.

### **Reduction Rules**
1. **Commutation Rules:**
   - `comm-AB`: `A# #B → #B A#`
   - `comm-BA`: `B# #A → #A B#`
   
2. **Annihilation Rules:**
   - `anni-AA`: `A# #A → ε` (removes the pair)
   - `anni-BB`: `B# #B → ε` (removes the pair)

---

## **Understanding Reduction Steps**

### **Types of Reduction Steps**
1. **Commutation Steps:**
   - These steps **reorder** symbols without changing the term's length.
   - Example: Applying `comm-AB` to `A# #B` transforms it to `#B A#`.

2. **Annihilation Steps:**
   - These steps **remove** specific pairs of symbols, thereby **reducing** the term's length by **2**.
   - Example: Applying `anni-AA` to `A# #A` removes both symbols, decreasing the term length.

### **Impact of Reduction Steps on Term Length**
- **Commutation:** Maintains the term length.
- **Annihilation:** Decreases the term length by 2.

---

## **Maximizing Reduction Steps**

To find the **maximum number of reduction steps**, we consider the **worst-case scenario** where the term requires the most commutations before any annihilations can occur. This typically happens when symbols that can annihilate each other are **maximally separated**, necessitating multiple commutations to bring them together.

### **Step-by-Step Analysis**

1. **Initial Term Length:** \( 2N \) symbols.
   
2. **Objective:** Reduce the term to its **normal form**, where no further reductions are possible.

3. **Reduction Strategy:**
   - **Maximize Commutations:** Arrange the term such that each annihilation pair (`A# #A` or `B# #B`) is as far apart as possible, requiring the maximum number of commutations to bring them together.
   - **Follow with Annihilations:** After sufficient commutations, perform annihilation steps to reduce the term length.

4. **Calculating Maximum Steps:**
   - **Each Annihilation Requires:** Bringing a pair together via commutations.
   - **Number of Pairs:** \( N \) pairs (since the term length is \( 2N \)).
   - **Commutations per Pair:** In the worst case, each pair might require up to \( 2N \) commutations to align correctly.
   
5. **Total Reduction Steps:**
   - **Commutation Steps:** Approximately \( O(N^2) \) (since each of the \( N \) pairs may require up to \( 2N \) commutations).
   - **Annihilation Steps:** \( N \) (one for each pair).

6. **Combined Steps:** The total number of steps is dominated by the **commutation steps**, resulting in a complexity of \( O(N^2) \).

---

## **Illustrative Example**

Consider a term with \( N = 2 \) (length \( 4 \)):

```
Initial Term: A# B# #A #B
```

**Reduction Steps:**
1. **Step 1:** Apply `comm-AB` to `A# #B`:
   ```
   A# #B → #B A#
   Term: #B A# #A #B
   ```
   
2. **Step 2:** Apply `comm-BA` to `B# #A`:
   ```
   B# #A → #A B#
   Term: #A B# #B
   ```
   
3. **Step 3:** Apply `anni-BB` to `B# #B`:
   ```
   B# #B → ε
   Term: #A
   ```

**Total Steps:** 3

While this example doesn't fully illustrate the quadratic nature, it demonstrates the interplay between commutations and annihilations.

## **General Conclusion**

- **Maximum Number of Reduction Steps:**  
  For a term of length \( 2N \), the **maximum number of reduction steps** required to reach normal form in the AB system is proportional to \( N^2 \).

- **Final Answer:**  
  **The maximum number of reduction steps for a term of length \( 2N \) is proportional to \( N^2 \).**  
  In other words, for a term with \( 2N \) symbols, the maximum number of steps required to reach normal form is on the order of \( N^2 \).
